    title: "Your Addiction Isn't a Moral Failing, It's a Nervous System Problem",
    excerpt: "Stop blaming yourself. Learn how addiction is a biological response to trauma and a dysregulated nervous system.",
    content: `For decades, we've been told a story about addiction: that it's a choice, a moral failing, a lack of willpower. We've been shamed, blamed, and punished. We've been told to "just say no," to "hit rock bottom," to "try harder."

And it hasn't worked.

What if that entire story is wrong? What if your addiction isn't a sign that you're weak or broken, but a sign that your nervous system is overwhelmed and dysregulated?

This is the core principle of a trauma-informed approach to recovery. It's a paradigm shift that moves us from blame and shame to compassion and understanding.`,

    excerpt: "Stop beating yourself up. Discover the science-backed power of self-compassion in addiction recovery.",
    content: `In the world of addiction recovery, we talk a lot about tough love, hitting rock bottom, and radical honesty. But there's another tool that may be the single most important factor in long-term recovery: self-compassion.

For many of us, the idea of being kind to ourselves feels foreign or wrong. We believe that if we are hard enough on ourselves, we'll finally change. But what if that approach is actually fueling your addiction?`,

    title: "Why Your Inner Child Might Be Driving Your Addiction",
    excerpt: "Unhealed childhood wounds don't just fade away—they show up in your adult relationships, your self-worth, and yes, your addiction.",
    content: `There's a part of you that never grew up. Not because you're immature or stunted, but because that part of you—your inner child—got stuck in a moment of pain, fear, or abandonment that was never fully processed or healed.

And now, decades later, that wounded child is still running the show. Your inner child is the one reaching for the bottle when you feel rejected. It's the one that spirals into shame when you make a mistake.`,

    title: "Why You Can't Think Your Way Out of Trauma (And What to Do Instead)",
    excerpt: "Trauma lives in your body, not just your mind. Here's why talk therapy alone isn't enough—and what somatic healing can do.",
    content: `You've been in therapy for years. You've talked about your childhood, your trauma, your triggers. You understand why you do what you do. You have insight. You have awareness.

So why are you still stuck?

Here's the hard truth: You can't think your way out of trauma. Trauma doesn't live in your thoughts. It lives in your body.`,

    title: "Beyond Sobriety: Introducing the REWIRED Method for Lasting Recovery",
    excerpt: "Sobriety is just the beginning. The REWIRED Method is a trauma-informed framework for building a life worth staying sober for.",
    content: `Most recovery programs focus on one thing: stopping the substance. And yes, that's important. But sobriety alone is not recovery.

True recovery is about becoming whole. It's about processing trauma, regulating your nervous system, and building a life that doesn't require escape.

That's why I created the REWIRED Method—a trauma-informed, nervous-system-focused framework for lasting recovery.`,
