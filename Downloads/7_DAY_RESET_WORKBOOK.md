# The 7-Day Reset
## Your Foundation for Lasting Sobriety

### By Shaun Critzer

---

## Welcome to Your Reset

This isn't just another sobriety workbook. This is your foundation—seven days of honest, practical work that will set you up for lasting recovery.

I'm not going to sugarcoat it: these seven days will be hard. You'll face uncomfortable truths. You'll feel cravings. You'll want to quit.

But if you commit to this process—really commit—you'll build the foundation you need to stay sober.

Each day focuses on one essential element of early recovery:

- **Day 1: Honesty** - Facing the truth about your addiction
- **Day 2: Support** - Building your recovery network
- **Day 3: Triggers** - Identifying and managing what makes you want to use
- **Day 4: Routines** - Creating structure that supports sobriety
- **Day 5: Shame** - Processing the guilt and self-hatred
- **Day 6: Resilience** - Building the strength to handle cravings
- **Day 7: Vision** - Creating a life worth staying sober for

Work through one day at a time. Don't skip ahead. Don't rush. Give yourself the gift of doing this right.

You've got this.

# Day 1: Honesty
## Facing the Truth About Your Addiction

### Morning Reflection

**The hardest part of recovery is admitting you have a problem.**

For years, I lied to myself. "I don't have a drinking problem. I can stop whenever I want. I'm just going through a rough patch."

The truth? I was an alcoholic. I couldn't stop. And my life was falling apart because of it.

Recovery starts with honesty. Brutal, uncomfortable honesty.

Today, you're going to face the truth about your addiction. No more excuses. No more minimizing. No more denial.

# Day 2: Support
## Building Your Recovery Network

### Morning Reflection

**You cannot do this alone.**

I tried to quit drinking on my own dozens of times. It never worked. I'd make it a few days, maybe a week, then I'd be right back where I started.

Recovery requires support. People who understand. People who've been there. People who will answer the phone at 2am when you're about to relapse.

Today, you're going to build your support network.

# Day 4: Routines
## Creating Structure That Supports Sobriety

### Morning Reflection

**Chaos is the enemy of recovery.**

When I was drinking, my life had no structure. I'd wake up hungover, stumble through the day, and drink again at night. Every day was the same mess.

Today, you're going to build a daily routine that supports your sobriety.

# Day 5: Shame
## Processing the Guilt and Self-Hatred

### Morning Reflection

**Shame is the voice that says: "I am bad."**

Guilt says: "I did something bad."  
Shame says: "I am bad."

Guilt is healthy. It motivates you to make amends and change your behavior.

Shame is toxic. It keeps you stuck in self-hatred and makes you want to use again.

Today, you're going to process your shame and start practicing self-compassion.

---

### Exercise 5.1: My Shame Inventory

**Your turn:**

**Shame statement:**
_________________________________________________________________

**Guilt reframe:**
_________________________________________________________________
_________________________________________________________________

---

### Exercise 5.3: Self-Compassion Practice

Imagine your best friend came to you and said: "I'm such a failure. I ruined everything. I don't deserve to be happy."

**What would you say to them?**
_________________________________________________________________
_________________________________________________________________
_________________________________________________________________

**Now say that to yourself.**

**Write a self-compassion letter:**

Dear [Your Name],

# Day 6: Resilience

→ _________________________________________________________________

**Examples:**
