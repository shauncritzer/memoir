## Day 17: The Wreckage of Addiction

### Video Lesson 17: Facing What You Broke (13 minutes)

**Key Concepts:**
- How addiction damages relationships
- The difference between repairing and rebuilding
- Why some relationships can't be saved
- The role of boundaries in healthy relationships
- Beginning the repair process

**Video Script Summary:**

*"Addiction doesn't just hurt you. It destroys the people around you.*

*I lost custody of my sons. I damaged my relationship with my parents. I burned bridges with friends. I became someone people couldn't trust.*

*Recovery means facing that wreckage. Not running from it. Not minimizing it. But looking at it honestly and asking: What can I repair? What can I rebuild? And what do I need to let go?*

*Some relationships can be saved. Some can't. And that's okay. Your job isn't to fix everything. Your job is to take responsibility, make amends where possible, and build new, healthy relationships moving forward."*

---

### Workbook Exercise 17.1: Relationship Inventory

**List the relationships damaged by your addiction:**

| Person | Relationship | How I hurt them | Can it be repaired? |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|---------------------|
|        |              |                 | Yes / No / Maybe    |
|        |              |                 | Yes / No / Maybe    |
|        |              |                 | Yes / No / Maybe    |
|        |              |                 | Yes / No / Maybe    |

## Day 18: Making Amends

### Video Lesson 18: Steps 8 and 9 (14 minutes)

**Key Concepts:**
- The 12-step approach to amends
- Direct amends vs. living amends
- When making amends causes more harm
- How to make a proper amend
- What to do when amends are rejected

**Video Script Summary:**

*"Steps 8 and 9 in AA are about making amends. Step 8: Make a list of people you harmed. Step 9: Make direct amends wherever possible, except when doing so would injure them or others.*

*A proper amend has three parts:*

*1. **Acknowledgment:** I did this specific thing.  
2. **Responsibility:** It was wrong. I take full responsibility.  
3. **Action:** This is how I'm making it right.*

*It's not an explanation. It's not an excuse. It's not asking for forgiveness. It's taking responsibility and changing your behavior.*

*Some amends are direct: 'I'm sorry I stole from you. Here's the money back.'*

*Some amends are living: 'I can't undo the years I was absent. But I'm showing up now. Every day.'*

*And some amends shouldn't be made—because they would cause more harm. If reaching out would hurt the other person, the amend is to leave them alone and live better."*

---

### Workbook Exercise 18.1: Your Amends List

**List people you need to make amends to:**

1. ______________________________ Type: Direct / Living / No contact
2. ______________________________ Type: Direct / Living / No contact
3. ______________________________ Type: Direct / Living / No contact
4. ______________________________ Type: Direct / Living / No contact
5. ______________________________ Type: Direct / Living / No contact

**For each person, plan your amend:**

**Person:** _______________________________________________________

**What I did:** ___________________________________________________

**My amend:**
_________________________________________________________________
_________________________________________________________________

**When I'll do it:** _______________________________________________

---

### Workbook Exercise 18.2: The Amend Script

**Write out what you'll say:**

**Example:**

*"Dad, I want to make an amend to you. For the years I was drinking, I was selfish, unreliable, and dishonest. I lied to you. I stole from you. I caused you pain and worry. That was wrong. I take full responsibility. I can't undo the past, but I'm committed to being a better son moving forward. I'm sober now, and I'm working on myself. I hope you'll give me a chance to prove it."*

**Your amend:**

## Day 19: Rebuilding Trust

### Video Lesson 19: Trust Is Earned, Not Given (12 minutes)

**Key Concepts:**
- Why trust takes time to rebuild
- The difference between words and actions
- How to be trustworthy
- Dealing with skepticism and doubt
- Patience in the rebuilding process

**Video Script Summary:**

*"You can't demand trust. You can't rush it. You can only earn it—slowly, through consistent action.*

*When I got sober, I wanted my sons to trust me immediately. I wanted them to forget the years I let them down and just believe I was different now.*

*But that's not how trust works. Trust is built through repeated, consistent action over time.*

*Every promise you keep. Every time you show up. Every time you choose sobriety over selfishness. That's a deposit in the trust bank.*

*It takes years to break trust. It takes years to rebuild it. That's just the reality.*

*Your job is to be patient. To keep showing up. To prove through your actions—not your words—that you're different now."*

---

### Workbook Exercise 19.1: Trust Assessment

**For each important relationship, assess trust:**

**Person:** _______________________________________________________

**How much do they trust me now? (1-10):** _____

**What specific actions broke their trust?**
_________________________________________________________________

**What actions will rebuild trust?**
_________________________________________________________________
_________________________________________________________________

**How long might it take?**
_________________________________________________________________

**Am I willing to be patient?** Yes / No

---

### Workbook Exercise 19.2: The Trust-Building Plan

**Choose one relationship to focus on:**

**Person:** _______________________________________________________

**Three specific actions I'll take to rebuild trust:**

1. _____________________________________________________________
   (Example: Call every Sunday like I promise)

2. _____________________________________________________________
   (Example: Be on time for every visit)

3. _____________________________________________________________
   (Example: Be honest even when it's hard)

**How I'll track my progress:**
_________________________________________________________________

**Who will hold me accountable:**
_________________________________________________________________

---

## Day 20: Setting Healthy Boundaries

### Video Lesson 20: Boundaries Are Not Walls (13 minutes)

**Key Concepts:**
- What boundaries are (and aren't)
- Why boundaries are essential in recovery
- How to set boundaries without guilt
- Dealing with boundary violations
- The difference between boundaries and ultimatums

**Video Script Summary:**

*"Boundaries are not walls. They're not about keeping people out. They're about protecting your recovery while staying connected.*

*A boundary is: 'I can't be around you when you're drinking.'  
A wall is: 'I'm cutting you out of my life forever.'*

*A boundary is: 'I need you to respect my sobriety and not offer me drinks.'  
A wall is: 'I'm never going to social events again.'*

*Boundaries are healthy. Walls are fear-based.*

*In recovery, you need boundaries. With family who enable you. With friends who still use. With anyone who threatens your sobriety.*

*Setting boundaries feels uncomfortable. You'll feel guilty. You'll worry about hurting people. But boundaries aren't selfish—they're self-preservation."*

---

### Workbook Exercise 20.1: Boundary Assessment

**Do you need boundaries with:**

□ Family members who enable or criticize  
□ Friends who still drink/use  
□ Romantic partners who don't support your recovery

**Boundary:** _____________________________________________________

---

### Workbook Exercise 20.2: Boundary Scripts

**How to communicate boundaries:**

**Example:**

*"I care about you, but I can't be around you when you're drinking. It's not about judging you—it's about protecting my sobriety. I hope you understand."*

**Your boundary script:**

_________________________________________________________________
_________________________________________________________________
_________________________________________________________________

**What if they don't respect it?**

_________________________________________________________________
_________________________________________________________________

**What will you do?**

_________________________________________________________________

### Video Lesson 21: Now What? (12 minutes)

**Key Concepts:**
- The existential crisis of early recovery
- Why sobriety alone isn't enough
- The importance of purpose
- Common traps (workaholism, new addictions)
- Beginning to explore what matters

**Video Script Summary:**

*"Getting sober is hard. Staying sober is harder. But the hardest part? Figuring out who you are and what your life is about now.*

*For years, your identity was 'addict.' Your purpose was getting high. Your days revolved around using.*

*Now that's gone. And you're left with a void.*

*Some people fill that void with work. Or the gym. Or new relationships. Or food. They trade one addiction for another.*

*But real recovery means filling that void with purpose. With meaning. With something worth staying sober for.*

*For me, it's my sons. It's helping other people in recovery. It's using my story to make a difference.*

*What's your purpose? What makes your life worth living? That's what this module is about."*

---

### Workbook Exercise 21.1: The Void Inventory

**What did addiction give you (even if it was destructive)?**

□ Identity (I was 'the party guy,' 'the wild one')  
□ Community (drinking/using buddies)

□ Escape (from pain, boredom, responsibility)  
□ Confidence (liquid courage)  
□ Fun (or what I thought was fun)  
□ Other: _________________________________________________

**What's missing now that you're sober?**

**Key Concepts:**
- The difference between goals and values
- Common values in recovery
- How to identify your core values
- Living in alignment with your values
- Values-based decision making

**Video Script Summary:**

*"Goals are destinations. Values are directions.*

*A goal is: 'I want to stay sober for a year.'  
A value is: 'I value health, honesty, and connection.'*

*Goals are important. But values are what guide you when goals get hard.*

*When I'm tempted to drink, I don't think about my sobriety goal. I think about my values: I value being a present father. I value integrity. I value growth.*

*Those values remind me who I want to be. And that's stronger than any craving.*

*What are your values? What do you stand for? When you know that, decisions get easier."*

---

### Workbook Exercise 22.1: Values Clarification

**Circle the values that resonate most with you:**

Honesty • Integrity • Courage • Compassion • Connection • Family • Health • Growth • Service • Creativity • Freedom • Responsibility • Humility • Gratitude • Resilience • Authenticity • Purpose • Love • Peace • Justice

**Key Concepts:**
- Why service is essential in recovery
- The 12th step: carrying the message
- How helping others helps you
- Different ways to serve
- Finding your unique contribution

**Video Script Summary:**

*"Step 12 says: 'Having had a spiritual awakening, we tried to carry this message to alcoholics and to practice these principles in all our affairs.'*

*In other words: help others.*

*Service is not optional in recovery. It's essential. Because when you help someone else, you remember why you're sober. You remember how bad it was. You remember what's at stake.*

*And you give someone else hope. You show them: if this guy can do it, maybe I can too.*

*Service doesn't have to mean sponsoring people or speaking at meetings. It can be volunteering. Donating. Showing up for your family. Using your skills to make a difference.*

*For me, it's this work—sharing my story, creating resources, helping people find their way out of the darkness.*

*What's your service? How will you give back?"*

**Video Script Summary:**

*"Recovery is not about white-knuckling through a joyless existence. It's about building a life so good you don't want to escape it.*

*For years, I was just surviving. I was sober, but I wasn't happy. I was going through the motions.*

*Thriving started when I gave myself permission to enjoy life. To have fun. To pursue things that brought me joy—not just things that were productive.*

*I started writing. I started spending real time with my sons. I started building a business I care about. I started dating again. I started living.*

*That's what recovery is supposed to be. Not just sobriety. But a life worth living."*

2. **Mental relapse:** You start thinking about using. Romanticizing the past. Bargaining ('Maybe just one').  
3. **Physical relapse:** You pick up.*

*"Recovery is not about returning to who you were before addiction. It's about becoming someone new.*

*Someone who's faced their trauma and healed it.  
Someone who's learned to love themselves.  
Someone who's built a life worth living.  
Someone who shows up for the people they love.  
Someone who uses their pain to help others.*

*Who are you becoming?*

*That's the question that drives recovery. Not who you were. Not who you wish you were. But who you're actively becoming through the choices you make every day."*

# Final Thoughts

Thirteen years ago, I couldn't imagine 30 days sober. Today, I have over 4,700 days.

It's possible. Not easy, but possible.

You don't have to be perfect. You just have to keep showing up.

One day at a time.
