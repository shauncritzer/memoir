# From Broken to Whole
## A 30-Day Journey from Addiction to Wholeness

### Part 1: Modules 1-4

**By Shaun Critzer**

---

## Welcome to Your Journey

This is not just a course about staying sober. This is a course about healing the wounds that led to addiction in the first place.

For 30 days, you'll go deep. You'll face your trauma. You'll process your shame. You'll reconnect with the parts of yourself you've been running from. You'll rebuild your life from the ground up.

This work is hard. It will be uncomfortable. You'll want to quit.

But if you stick with it, you'll come out the other side whole.

Not perfect. Not fixed. But whole.

Ready to begin?

**Days 1-4 | 4 Video Lessons**

## Day 1: Why You Can't Just Stop

### Video Lesson 1: The Trauma-Addiction Connection (15 minutes)

**Key Concepts:**
- Addiction is not a moral failing—it's a response to pain
- The role of trauma in addiction
- Why willpower alone doesn't work
- The difference between sobriety and recovery
- What healing actually requires

**Video Script Summary:**

*"I tried to quit drinking hundreds of times. I'd white-knuckle it for a few days, maybe a week. Then I'd be right back where I started.*

*I thought I was weak. I thought I lacked willpower. I thought I was broken.*

*The truth? I was trying to solve the wrong problem.*

*Addiction is not the problem. Addiction is the solution—to a deeper problem.*

*For me, that deeper problem was trauma. Childhood wounds. Shame. Self-hatred. Pain I didn't know how to process.*

*Alcohol numbed that pain. It worked—until it didn't.*

*You can't just stop drinking or using. You have to heal the wounds that made you need it in the first place.*

*That's what this course is about. Not just sobriety. Healing."*

*Mine was: 'I'm not enough.'*

*I wasn't smart enough. Wasn't successful enough. Wasn't a good enough father. Wasn't lovable enough.*

*That belief drove everything. The drinking. The self-sabotage. The shame.*

*Your core wound might be different. Maybe it's 'I'm unlovable.' Or 'I'm broken.' Or 'I don't belong.'*

*Whatever it is, it's a lie. But it feels true. And it's been running your life.*

*Healing starts with identifying the wound. Then we can start to heal it."*

Guilt says: 'I did something bad.'*

*Guilt is healthy. It motivates you to make amends and change your behavior.*

*Shame is toxic. It tells you you're fundamentally flawed. Unworthy. Broken beyond repair.*

*Shame is the voice that says: 'You're a piece of shit. You don't deserve recovery. You're going to fail.'*

*And when you believe that, you use. Because why not? You're already worthless.*

*Breaking free from shame is essential to recovery."*

Guilt: "I missed my son's birthday because I was drunk"

**Now reframe your shame statements into guilt statements:**

**Shame:** _______________________________________________________  
**Guilt:** ________________________________________________________

*You'd probably say something like: 'You're being too hard on yourself. You made mistakes, but you're learning. You deserve compassion.'*

*Why can't you say that to yourself?*

*Self-compassion is not self-pity. It's not letting yourself off the hook. It's treating yourself with the same kindness you'd offer a friend.*

*But carrying guilt doesn't help anyone. It doesn't undo the past. It doesn't make amends. It just keeps you stuck.*

*Forgiving yourself doesn't mean forgetting. It doesn't mean what you did was okay. It means: 'I did that. It was wrong. I take responsibility. And I'm choosing to move forward and do better.'*

*Self-esteem says: 'I'm valuable because I'm successful, attractive, accomplished.'  
Self-worth says: 'I'm valuable because I exist.'*

*Addiction destroys self-esteem. You lose your job, your relationships, your health. You feel worthless.*

## Day 16: EMDR and Trauma Processing

### Video Lesson 16: Healing Trauma at the Root (14 minutes)

**Key Concepts:**
- What is EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing)?
- How EMDR works
- Other trauma therapies (IFS, Somatic Experiencing, Brainspotting)
- When to seek professional trauma therapy
- The importance of processing, not just managing

**Video Script Summary:**

*"EMDR changed my life.*

*It's a therapy that helps you process trauma by using bilateral stimulation (eye movements, tapping, sounds).*

*It sounds weird. But it works. The research is overwhelming.*

*I processed my childhood wounds. My shame. My fear. Things I'd been carrying for 30 years.*

*If you have trauma, you need trauma therapy. Talk therapy helps, but it's not enough.*

*Find an EMDR therapist. Or an IFS therapist. Or a somatic experiencing practitioner.*

*Do the deep work."*
