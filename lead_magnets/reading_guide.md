**Reflection Questions:**

1. **The Oxygen Tent:** Shaun describes feeling trapped and powerless as a child in the oxygen tent. What early childhood experiences made you feel powerless or unsafe?

1. **The Decade of Darkness:** Shaun calls 2002-2012 his "decade of darkness." What was your darkest period? What kept you going during that time?

3. **The Affair:** Shaun's affair was a symptom of his deeper brokenness. What destructive behaviors have you engaged in that were symptoms of unprocessed pain?

4. **Protective Orders:** Shaun lost access to his children. What relationships did your addiction destroy? What did you lose that you thought you'd never get back?

3. **The Serpent Vision:** Shaun's spiritual experience showed him he was being protected. Have you had moments where you felt something larger than yourself was at work in your recovery?

4. **Rigorous Honesty:** Shaun learned that half-measures don't work—recovery requires complete honesty. Where are you still holding back? What truth do you need to tell?

5. **Meeting Shannon:** Shannon saw Shaun at his worst and chose him anyway. Who has loved you through your brokenness? How did that change you?

**Group Discussion Prompt:**
