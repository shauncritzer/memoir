## About This Excerpt

Thank you for downloading the first three chapters of my memoir. This book took me years to write—not because the words were hard to find, but because the truth was hard to face.

If you're struggling with addiction, trauma, or the crushing weight of being human, I want you to know: **you are not alone, and you are not too far gone.**

This memoir contains frank discussions of childhood sexual abuse, substance abuse, suicidal ideation, and mental health crises. If you need support, please see the resources at the end of this document.

## What Happens Next?

The journey from that ABC store parking lot to 13 years of sobriety wasn't linear. It wasn't pretty. And it definitely wasn't easy.

In the full memoir, you'll discover:

- **The childhood trauma** I buried for decades and how it fueled my addiction
- **The decade of darkness** (2002-2012) - DUIs, protective orders, psych wards, and rock bottoms I didn't think I'd survive
- **The critical difference** between sobriety and recovery
- **The treatment and therapy** that finally cracked me open - EMDR, inner child work, and rigorous honesty
- **The redemption** - peaceful co-parenting, blended family, meaningful work, and a life beyond my wildest dreams
