### By Shaun Critzer

**A collection of tools, exercises, and resources to support your recovery journey—whether you're in active addiction, early recovery, or supporting someone who is.**

## Introduction

Recovery isn't just about not drinking or using. It's about becoming whole. It's about processing trauma, building authentic relationships, and creating a life worth staying sober for.

This toolkit contains practical exercises I've used in my own recovery and with others I've mentored. These aren't magic solutions—they're tools. And like any tool, they only work if you use them.

**What's inside:**
- Daily Recovery Check-In
- Trigger Identification Worksheet
- Gratitude Practice Template
- Amends Planning Guide
- Inner Child Healing Exercise
- Emergency Contact Card
- Recovery Milestone Tracker

□ What's one thing I can do today to support my recovery?

**Evening Reflection:**

□ What challenged me today?  
□ Did I use my tools when I needed them?

## Inner Child Healing Exercise

**Much of our addiction stems from childhood wounds. This exercise helps you connect with and heal your inner child.**

### Step 1: Find a Quiet Space
Set aside 15-20 minutes where you won't be interrupted.

### Step 2: Visualize Your Younger Self
Close your eyes. Picture yourself as a child—whatever age feels right. What are you wearing? Where are you? What do you look like?

### Step 3: Ask Questions
Imagine sitting down with this younger version of yourself. Ask:
- What do you need right now?
- What are you afraid of?
- What do you want me to know?

### Step 4: Offer Comfort
What does your inner child need to hear? Write it here:

Dear younger me,
_________________________________________________
_________________________________________________
_________________________________________________
_________________________________________________

### Step 5: Make a Promise
What can you promise your inner child? (Example: "I promise to protect you" or "I promise to listen to you")

My promise: _______________________________________
_________________________________________________

## Final Thoughts

Recovery is possible. I'm living proof.

Thirteen years ago, I was in psych wards, facing protective orders, losing my kids, and wanting to die. Today, I have a life beyond my wildest dreams—not because I'm special, but because I did the work.

You can too.

One day at a time.
