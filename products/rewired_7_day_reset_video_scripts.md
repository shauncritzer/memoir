## Video 1: Day 1 - RECOGNIZE (5-7 minutes)

**(Scene: Shaun in a calm, well-lit room. He looks directly at the camera.)**

**Shaun:** Hey, I'm Shaun. And if you're watching this, it's probably because you're tired. Tired of the patterns. Tired of the chaos. Tired of feeling stuck.

I get it. I've been there.

Today is Day 1 of the REWIRED Reset. And our focus today is on one word: **Recognize**.

We can't change what we don't acknowledge. For years, I was on autopilot. I'd have a stressful day at work, and the first thing I'd do is reach for a drink. I'd feel lonely, and I'd numb it. I'd get angry, and I'd suppress it.

Those were my patterns. My triggers. My programming.

Addiction isn't a moral failing. It's a survival mechanism. It's a dysregulated nervous system trying to find safety and relief in a world that feels overwhelming.

So today, I want you to do something radical. I want you to get honest with yourself, without the shame. I want you to recognize what's really going on.

In your workbook, you'll find a section for Day 1. I want you to write down your patterns. Your triggers. Your rock bottom moment.

Not to punish yourself. But to see it clearly. To understand the programming that's been running your life.

Because once you see the pattern, you can interrupt it. Once you understand the trigger, you can work with it. And once you acknowledge your rock bottom, you can use it as the foundation to build a new life.

This isn't about willpower. It's about awareness.

So take some time today. Be honest. Be brave. Recognize what's brought you here.

And know this: you're not alone. I'm here with you. And this is the first step to getting your life back.

I'll see you tomorrow for Day 2.

## Video 2: Day 2 - ESTABLISH (5-7 minutes)

**(Scene: Shaun in the same calm setting.)**

**Shaun:** Welcome to Day 2. Yesterday, we did the hard work of recognizing our patterns. Today, we focus on the second letter of REWIRED: **Establish**.

What are we establishing? Safety. Connection. Support.

The neuroscientist Johann Hari famously said, "The opposite of addiction is not sobriety. The opposite of addiction is connection."

He was right. Addiction thrives in isolation. It grows in the dark. It feeds on loneliness and shame.

Recovery, on the other hand, happens in community. It happens when we feel safe enough to be vulnerable. When we feel seen, heard, and understood.

For years, my world was small. It was me, my addiction, and my secrets. I didn't feel safe anywhere, especially not in my own skin.

Recovery began when I started to establish safety. First, in my environment. I got rid of the alcohol in my house. I stopped going to bars. I created a physical space where I could feel at ease.

But more importantly, I started to establish safe connections. I reached out to people who understood. I found a therapist. I joined a support group. I started to build a network of people who had my back.

Your task today is to think about safety and connection in your own life.

Who are the people who make you feel safe? Who are the people who drain your energy or trigger you?

Your workbook has a section for Day 2. I want you to make two lists: your safe people and your unsafe people. This isn't about judging them. It's about protecting your recovery.

You can't heal in a warzone. You need a sanctuary. You need a tribe.

Today, your work is to identify who and what makes you feel safe. And to take one small step toward establishing more of that in your life.

Maybe it's calling a friend. Maybe it's finding an online support group. Maybe it's just cleaning your room and making it a space you enjoy being in.

Whatever it is, do it. Because you can't do this alone. And you don't have to.

I'll see you tomorrow.

## Video 3: Day 3 - WORK (6-8 minutes)

**(Scene: Shaun, looking engaged and empathetic.)**

**Shaun:** Welcome back. Day 3. Today, we get to the heart of it. The third letter in REWIRED: **Work**.

And I don't mean work in the sense of hustling or grinding. I mean the inner work. The work of turning toward our triggers, not away from them.

For most of my life, when a difficult emotion came up—anger, sadness, fear—I had two responses: numb it or run from it. I thought the goal was to not feel those things.

But in recovery, I learned something profound: triggers are not the enemy. They are messengers. They are signposts pointing to the parts of us that need to heal.

A craving isn't just a craving. It's a signal that you're lonely, or stressed, or bored. Anger isn't just anger. It's a sign that a boundary has been crossed. Sadness isn't just sadness. It's a sign that you're grieving something you lost.

Our work is not to fight these feelings. It's to get curious about them. To investigate them. To ask, "What are you here to teach me?"

In your workbook today, you'll find a practice called RAIN. It stands for Recognize, Allow, Investigate, and Nurture. It's a simple but powerful tool for working with difficult emotions.

When a trigger comes up, instead of immediately reacting, you pause. You Recognize what's happening. You Allow the feeling to be there, without judgment. You Investigate it with curiosity—where is it in your body? What does it feel like? And then, you Nurture yourself with compassion.

This is the work. It's not about being perfect. It's about being present. It's about learning to stay with yourself, even when it's uncomfortable.

Because on the other side of that discomfort is freedom. On the other side of that trigger is healing.

So today, I invite you to be a detective of your inner world. Get curious. Be kind. And do the work.

It's the most important work you'll ever do.

See you tomorrow.

## Video 4: Day 4 - INTEGRATE (5-7 minutes)

**(Scene: Shaun, with a practical, encouraging tone.)**

**Shaun:** Day 4. We're halfway there. Today's word is **Integrate**.

We've done the deep work of recognizing, establishing, and working with our inner world. Now, we need to integrate these new ways of being into our daily lives. We need to build a structure that supports our recovery.

When I was in active addiction, my life was chaos. No routine. No predictability. My nervous system was constantly on high alert.

Recovery taught me the power of structure. The power of simple, consistent routines. Your nervous system loves predictability. When it knows what to expect, it can relax. It can move out of survival mode and into a state of healing and growth.

This isn't about being rigid or perfect. It's about creating anchors in your day that ground you and support you.

A morning routine that starts your day with intention, not reactivity. An evening routine that helps you wind down and reflect. A commitment to moving your body, eating regular meals, and getting enough sleep.

These things seem small, but they are the scaffolding of a sober life.

In your workbook, you'll find prompts to help you design your ideal morning and evening routines. Don't get overwhelmed. You don't have to do it all at once.

I'm a big believer in the 1% rule. Just get 1% better every day. Drink one more glass of water. Meditate for one minute. Write one sentence in your journal.

Small, consistent actions build momentum. They build self-trust. They integrate your recovery into the fabric of your life.

So your task today is simple: What's one small thing you can do to create more structure and support in your day? What's your 1% improvement?

Start there. And I'll see you tomorrow.

## Video 5: Day 5 - RELEASE (6-8 minutes)

**(Scene: Shaun, speaking with warmth and compassion.)**

**Shaun:** Welcome to Day 5. This is a big one. Today, we talk about **Release**.

What are we releasing? The shame. The guilt. The self-judgment. The heavy, toxic stories we've been carrying for years.

Shame was the fuel for my addiction. The voice in my head that said, "You're not good enough. You're a failure. You're broken." And every time I listened to that voice, I drank to escape it.

It's a vicious cycle. We feel shame, so we use. We use, and we feel more shame.

Recovery is about breaking that cycle. And the way we do that is by bringing shame into the light. By learning to treat ourselves with compassion, not contempt.

Dr. Brené Brown, the world's leading researcher on shame, says that shame cannot survive being spoken. It dies when we tell our stories in safe places.

But it also dies when we change the way we talk to ourselves.

For years, I had a drill sergeant in my head, constantly criticizing me. Recovery has been about firing that drill sergeant and hiring a compassionate coach instead.

When I mess up now, that coach doesn't say, "You're an idiot." He says, "This is hard. You're human. What can we learn from this?"

That's self-compassion. And it's not an excuse. It's a tool. It's what allows us to get back up when we fall down, instead of staying down and reaching for a drink.

Your work today is to practice self-compassion. In your workbook, you'll find the Self-Compassion Break, a simple practice to use when you notice that inner critic flaring up.

I want you to pay attention to how you talk to yourself today. And when you notice that voice of shame, I want you to gently, kindly, tell it to get lost.

You are not your past. You are not your mistakes. You are worthy of kindness, especially from yourself.

It's time to release the weight you've been carrying. It's time to come home to yourself.

I'll see you tomorrow.

## Video 6: Day 6 - EMBRACE (5-7 minutes)

**(Scene: Shaun, with a sense of pride and encouragement.)**

**Shaun:** Day 6. Can you feel the shift? Today, our word is **Embrace**.

We've spent the last five days recognizing, establishing, working, integrating, and releasing. We've been clearing out the wreckage of the past. Today, we start to build the new.

Today, we embrace who we are becoming.

For so long, my identity was wrapped up in my addiction. I was "the guy who could drink anyone under the table." I was "the life of the party." I was also "the guy who couldn't keep a promise." "The guy who let everyone down."

When I got sober, I had to figure out who I was without alcohol. And it was terrifying.

But slowly, through the daily work of recovery, a new identity began to emerge. I wasn't "Shaun the addict." I was "Shaun, the man who is resilient." "Shaun, the father who shows up." "Shaun, the person who is learning to be honest and kind."

This is the journey of recovery. It's not just about stopping something. It's about becoming someone new.

And you are becoming someone new. Every day you choose sobriety, you are choosing a new identity. You are choosing courage over comfort. You are choosing growth over stagnation.

Your task today is to embrace that new identity. In your workbook, you'll find an exercise to write down your "I am" statements. Not who you were. Not who you're afraid you are. But who you are choosing to become.

I am resilient. I am strong. I am worthy. I am a work in progress.

Write them down. Say them out loud. Feel them in your bones.

You are not defined by your worst moments. You are defined by how you rise from them.

Embrace the person you are becoming. They've been waiting for you.

See you for our final day tomorrow.

## Video 7: Day 7 - DEVELOP (6-8 minutes)

**(Scene: Shaun, looking forward, with a sense of hope and purpose.)**

**Shaun:** We made it. Day 7. The final letter in REWIRED: **Develop**.

Today, we look to the future. We develop a vision for the life we are building. A life worth staying sober for.

For a long time, my only goal was to not drink. And that's a crucial first step. But it's not enough. Sobriety is the ticket to the dance. It's not the dance itself.

The dance is the life you build. The relationships you nurture. The purpose you discover. The joy you cultivate.

So I want to ask you a question: What are you staying sober for? What is the vision that will pull you forward on the hard days? What is the "why" that will make the "how" possible?

Maybe it's being a present parent. Maybe it's starting a business. Maybe it's traveling the world. Maybe it's simply waking up in the morning and feeling at peace in your own skin.

There is no right or wrong answer. But you need an answer. You need a vision that is more compelling than the temporary relief of a drink or a drug.

In your workbook today, you'll find a visualization exercise to help you connect with your future self. The version of you that is thriving in recovery. The version of you that is living a life of purpose and meaning.

Don't just think about it. Feel it. What does it feel like to be that person? What joy, what peace, what freedom do they experience?

That person is not a fantasy. They are a possibility. They are the person you are becoming, one day at a time.

This 7-day reset is just the beginning. The journey of recovery is a marathon, not a sprint. But now you have a map. You have a toolkit. You have the REWIRED framework to guide you.

Recognize. Establish. Work. Integrate. Release. Embrace. Develop.

This is the path. This is the work. And it is the most rewarding work you will ever do.

Thank you for taking this journey with me. I'm proud of you. And I'm excited to see what you do with this new life you are creating.

Keep going.
