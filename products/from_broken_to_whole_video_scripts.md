## Module 1: The Foundation

### Video 1.1: The Trauma-Addiction Connection (15 minutes)

**(Scene: Shaun in a calm, well-lit room, looking directly at the camera with a serious but empathetic expression.)**

**Shaun:** Welcome to From Broken to Whole. I’m Shaun, and I’m glad you’re here. But I know that if you’re here, it’s because you’re in pain. You’re tired of the fight. You’re wondering why you can’t just stop.

I want to start by telling you something that might sound controversial: your addiction is not your biggest problem.

I tried to quit drinking hundreds of times. I’d white-knuckle it for a few days, maybe a week, full of resolve and self-hatred. Then the cravings, the anxiety, the sheer exhaustion would hit, and I’d be right back where I started. Every single time.

I thought I was weak. I thought I lacked willpower. I thought I was fundamentally broken, a moral failure.

The truth? I was trying to solve the wrong problem.

Addiction is not the problem. Addiction is the *solution*—a temporary, destructive solution—to a much deeper problem.

For me, and for millions of others, that deeper problem was trauma. It was childhood wounds I never processed. It was a deep-seated shame and self-hatred that I carried every single day. It was a level of pain I didn’t know how to process, so I numbed it.

Alcohol was my solution. It worked, for a while. It quieted the voices. It numbed the pain. It gave me a temporary escape from a reality that felt unbearable.

But the solution became the problem. It started demanding more and more, and giving less and less, until it took everything.

This is the trauma-addiction cycle. And you cannot break it with willpower alone. You can’t just “stop” using. You have to heal the wounds that made you need the substance in the first place.

That is what this course is about. We are not just aiming for sobriety—for the absence of a substance. We are aiming for *recovery*. For healing. For wholeness.

Over the next 30 days, we’re going to go deep. We’re going to explore the roots of your addiction. We’re going to work with the trauma, the shame, and the pain. And we’re going to build a new foundation for your life, one based on self-compassion, connection, and purpose.

It’s going to be hard work. It will be uncomfortable. But I promise you, it is the most worthwhile work you will ever do.

Let’s get started. Open your workbook to Day 1, and let’s begin to understand the connection between your trauma and your addiction.

### Video 1.2: Why Sobriety Alone Isn't Enough (12 minutes)

**(Scene: Shaun, same setting, leaning in slightly to emphasize his point.)**

**Shaun:** Yesterday, we talked about the trauma-addiction connection. Today, I want to make a critical distinction: the difference between sobriety and recovery.

I know people who have been sober for years, and they are some of the most miserable people I’ve ever met. They don’t drink or use, but they’re angry, they’re bitter, they’re resentful, they’re isolated. They’re what we call a ‘dry drunk.’

They’ve removed the substance, but they haven’t done the healing. They’re abstinent, but they’re not in recovery.

**Sobriety is not drinking. Recovery is healing.**

Let me say that again. Sobriety is not drinking. Recovery is healing.

Sobriety is absolutely necessary. It’s the price of admission. You can’t do the work of healing if you’re still numbing yourself. But it is not sufficient. It’s the starting line, not the finish line.

Recovery is the process of addressing the trauma we talked about yesterday. It’s learning to feel your feelings without running away. It’s processing the shame that’s been weighing you down. It’s learning how to build healthy, authentic relationships. It’s finding a sense of purpose and meaning in your life. It’s about becoming whole.

For years, I was just sober. I was a dry drunk. I was sober, but I was still a prisoner of my past, of my anger, of my shame. I was sober, but I wasn’t free.

Freedom comes from recovery. From doing the inner work. From healing the wounds.

This course is about recovery. We are going to give you the tools and the framework to not just stay sober, but to build a life that is so rich, so meaningful, so connected, that you no longer need or want to escape from it.

In your workbook for Day 2, you’ll find a checklist to help you assess where you are right now. Are you just focused on sobriety? Or are you truly in recovery? Be honest with yourself. There’s no judgment here. Just awareness.

Because once you know where you are, you can start taking steps toward where you want to be.

### Video 1.3: The Core Wound (14 minutes)

**(Scene: Shaun, speaking with vulnerability and intensity.)**

**Shaun:** In my experience, both personally and working with hundreds of people in recovery, most of us have what I call a ‘core wound.’ It’s a deep, often unconscious belief about ourselves that drives almost all of our self-destructive behavior.

My core wound was: ‘I’m not enough.’

It started in childhood, with a father who was impossible to please. No matter what I did, it was never good enough. I got straight A’s, and he’d ask why I didn’t get an A+. I’d win a wrestling match, and he’d critique my technique.

I internalized that voice. It became my own. I wasn’t smart enough. I wasn’t successful enough. I wasn’t a good enough father, a good enough husband, a good enough man.

That belief, that core wound of ‘not enough,’ drove everything. It drove my workaholism, my perfectionism, my constant need for external validation. And when all of that failed to fill the void, it drove my drinking.

Your core wound might be different. Maybe it’s ‘I’m unlovable.’ Maybe it’s ‘I’m broken,’ or ‘I’m bad,’ or ‘I don’t belong.’

Whatever it is, I want you to understand something crucial: **it is a lie.**

It’s a story that was programmed into you, likely at a very young age. But it feels true. It feels like the truest thing about you. And it has been running your life from the shadows.

Healing, true recovery, starts with identifying that wound. With bringing it out of the darkness and into the light. With seeing it for what it is: a story, not a fact.

In your workbook for Day 3, we’re going to start this process. We’re going to explore some common core wounds and help you identify the one that resonates most with you. And then, we’re going to start gathering evidence against it.

This is deep work. It can be painful. But it is the path to freedom. You cannot heal a wound you don’t know you have.

So take a deep breath. Be brave. And let’s go find the lie that’s been holding you hostage.

### Video 1.4: Rewriting Your Story (13 minutes)

**(Scene: Shaun, with a hopeful and empowering tone.)**

**Shaun:** For years, the story I told myself was this: ‘I’m a drunk. I’m a failure. I’m a bad father. I ruin everything I touch.’

And because that was my story, it became my identity. And because it was my identity, it became my reality. I lived down to my own expectations. I became the villain in my own story.

We all have stories. They are the narratives we construct to make sense of our lives. But sometimes, those stories become prisons. They limit us. They define us. They keep us stuck.

Recovery is, in many ways, the act of rewriting your story.

This is not about denying the past. It’s not about pretending the bad things didn’t happen. It’s about changing the *meaning* you give to those events. It’s about changing the role you play in the narrative.

My old story: ‘I’m a drunk who abandoned his kids.’ In that story, I am a villain. I am hopeless. My fate is sealed.

My new story: ‘I am a man who struggled with addiction as a result of unresolved trauma. In that struggle, I hurt people I love more than anything in the world. Today, I am in recovery, and I am working every single day to heal, to make amends, and to be the father my kids deserve.’

Do you see the difference? The facts are the same. The pain is still there. But the role I play has changed. I am no longer the villain. I am the survivor. I am the person who is rising from the ashes.

**You are not your past. You are not your mistakes. You are the author of your own story.**

And you get to decide how the next chapter goes.

Today, in your workbook, you’re going to do two things. First, you’re going to write down your old story, the one that’s been keeping you trapped. Then, you’re going to write your new one. The story of the person you are becoming.

This isn’t just an exercise. This is an act of power. This is you taking back the pen.

So, what’s your new story going to be?

## Module 2: Shame and Self-Compassion

### Video 2.1: Shame vs. Guilt (14 minutes)

**(Scene: Shaun, same setting, speaking with a gentle but firm tone.)**

**Shaun:** Welcome to Module 2. This week, we are going to tackle one of the most toxic and powerful drivers of addiction: shame.

First, we need to understand the difference between shame and guilt. They are not the same thing, and confusing them can keep you stuck for years.

It’s simple:

**Guilt says: ‘I *did* something bad.’**
**Shame says: ‘I *am* bad.’**

Guilt is a healthy, adaptive emotion. When you violate your own values, you *should* feel guilty. That feeling motivates you to apologize, to make amends, to change your behavior. Guilt is a pro-social emotion that helps us repair our relationships and live in integrity.

Shame, on the other hand, is toxic. It’s the intensely painful feeling or experience of believing that we are flawed and therefore unworthy of love and belonging. Shame is not about your actions; it’s about your identity. It’s the voice that whispers, or screams: ‘You’re a piece of shit. You’re broken beyond repair. You don’t deserve recovery. You’re just going to fail again, so why even try?’

And when you believe that, what do you do? You use. Because if you’re already worthless, what’s the point? Shame is the jet fuel of the addiction cycle.

I lived in shame for decades. I thought the shame was what I deserved. I thought it would keep me in line. But it did the opposite. It drove me deeper into isolation and addiction.

Breaking free from shame is not optional in recovery. It is essential.

Your work today is to start untangling shame from guilt. In your workbook, you’ll find an exercise to help you look at the things you feel bad about and ask: Is this shame, or is this guilt? Am I feeling bad about who I am, or what I did?

This distinction is the first step to disarming the power of shame and stepping into the freedom of recovery.

### Video 2.2: Talking to Yourself Like a Friend (12 minutes)

**(Scene: Shaun, with a warm, compassionate expression.)**

**Shaun:** Most of us, especially those of us who have struggled with addiction, talk to ourselves in ways we would *never* talk to someone we love.

Think about it. If your best friend came to you, full of shame, and said, ‘I’m such a failure. I ruined everything. I don’t deserve to be happy,’ what would you say to them?

You wouldn’t say, ‘Yeah, you’re right, you’re a total piece of garbage.’

No. You’d say something like: ‘Hey, be easy on yourself. You’re human. You made mistakes, but you’re learning from them. You are worthy of love and forgiveness, and I’m here for you.’

So here’s the million-dollar question: **Why can’t you say that to yourself?**

This is the practice of self-compassion. And for many of us, it’s a foreign language. We’re fluent in self-criticism, but we’re illiterate in self-kindness.

Dr. Kristin Neff, a leading researcher in this field, defines self-compassion as having three core components:

1.  **Self-Kindness:** Treating yourself with the same warmth and understanding you’d give a friend.
2.  **Common Humanity:** Recognizing that suffering and imperfection are part of the shared human experience. You are not alone in your struggles.
3.  **Mindfulness:** Observing your painful thoughts and feelings without judgment, so that you’re not overwhelmed by them.

Self-compassion is not self-pity. It’s not making excuses. It’s not letting yourself off the hook. It is the practice of motivating yourself with kindness rather than criticism. And the research is clear: it is one of the most powerful predictors of long-term, sustainable recovery.

In your workbook today, you’ll find a simple but profound practice called the Self-Compassion Break. It’s a way to interrupt the cycle of self-criticism in the moment and offer yourself a dose of kindness.

This will feel awkward at first. It might even feel wrong. But I’m asking you to try it. Because you cannot hate yourself into a version of yourself you can love.

Healing happens in an atmosphere of compassion. Let’s start creating that for ourselves, today.

### Video 2.3: Forgiving Yourself (13 minutes)

**(Scene: Shaun, speaking with a gentle, reflective tone.)**

**Shaun:** I spent years hating myself for the things I did when I was drinking. The lies I told. The promises I broke. The people I hurt. The pain I caused my family.

I carried that guilt and shame like a backpack full of rocks. I thought I needed to. I thought it was my punishment. I thought if I ever let it go, it would mean that what I did was okay. I thought I didn’t deserve forgiveness.

Maybe you feel that way right now.

But here’s what I learned in recovery: carrying those rocks doesn’t help anyone. It doesn’t undo the past. It doesn’t heal the people you hurt. It doesn’t make amends. All it does is keep you stuck. It keeps you small. It keeps you in a prison of your own making.

**Forgiving yourself does not mean forgetting what you did.** It does not mean condoning it or saying it was okay. It wasn’t okay.

Forgiving yourself means accepting that it happened. It means taking responsibility for it. And it means making a conscious choice to release the burden of self-hatred so that you can move forward and do better.

It’s a declaration that says: ‘I did that. It was wrong. I own it. And I will not let my past define my future. I am committed to learning, to growing, and to living differently from this day forward.’

You cannot heal while you are actively hating yourself. It’s like trying to build a house while you’re setting it on fire.

Self-forgiveness is not a one-time event. It’s a practice. It’s something you have to choose again and again. But it is a choice.

Today, in your workbook, we’re going to begin that practice. We’re going to identify the things you’re holding against yourself, and we’re going to create a forgiveness statement.

This might be the hardest work you do in this course. But it is also the work that will set you free.

You deserve to be free. Let’s start today.

### Video 2.4: Building Self-Worth (14 minutes)

**(Scene: Shaun, with a confident and reassuring presence.)**

**Shaun:** There’s a critical difference between self-esteem and self-worth, and understanding it can change your life.

**Self-esteem is based on what you *do*.** It’s conditional. It says, ‘I’m valuable because I’m successful, because I’m attractive, because I’m smart, because I achieve things, because people like me.’ The problem with self-esteem is that it’s fragile. The moment you fail, or get rejected, or lose your job, it shatters.

**Self-worth, on the other hand, is based on who you *are*.** It’s unconditional. It’s inherent. It says, ‘I am valuable simply because I exist. I am worthy of love and belonging, not because of my accomplishments, but because of my humanity.’

Addiction absolutely demolishes self-esteem. You lose the job, the relationships, the health, the respect. You look in the mirror and you see a failure. You feel worthless.

But here’s the truth: **your self-worth can never be destroyed.** It can be buried. It can be forgotten. You can lose touch with it. But it is always there, waiting for you to reclaim it.

Recovery is the process of digging through the rubble of your life to uncover the truth of your inherent worth. It’s about remembering that you are valuable, not for what you do, but for who you are.

This isn’t about arrogance or ego. It’s about a quiet, solid, internal sense of your own value. It’s the foundation upon which a healthy life is built.

When you know your worth, you set better boundaries. You choose healthier relationships. You stop tolerating abuse, from others and from yourself. You stop believing the lies of your inner critic.

So how do we build it? We practice. We act as if it’s true, even when we don’t feel it. We challenge the belief that our value is conditional. We practice affirmations, not as wishful thinking, but as a way to rewire our brains.

Today, in your workbook, we’re going to explore the difference between self-esteem and self-worth in your own life. And you’re going to choose some affirmations to begin the practice of reclaiming your worth.

This is the bedrock. You are enough. Exactly as you are. Let’s start acting like it.

## Module 3: The Inner Child

### Video 3.1: The Wounded Child Inside You (15 minutes)

**(Scene: Shaun, same setting, his tone becomes softer, more introspective.)**

**Shaun:** This week, we’re going to go to the root. We’re going to meet the part of you that is the source of so much of your pain, and also the source of your greatest potential for healing. We’re going to meet your inner child.

Inside every one of us who has struggled with addiction, there is a wounded child. A younger version of ourselves, frozen in time, still carrying the pain of things that happened long ago.

For me, it was a 7-year-old boy who felt abandoned and alone. A little boy who learned that his feelings didn’t matter, that he wasn’t enough. A boy who learned to numb his pain and hide his true self to survive.

That child never got what he needed. He didn’t get the safety, the validation, the unconditional love that every child deserves. So he grew up into an adult who was constantly, desperately trying to fill that void, to quiet that pain—and he found a solution in alcohol.

My addiction was, in essence, my wounded inner child’s attempt to cope with unbearable pain.

Your inner child is still inside you right now. Still carrying their wounds. Still whispering their fears. Still driving many of your adult behaviors, your relationship patterns, and your addictive urges.

Healing from addiction, at its core, means going back and healing that wounded child. It means building a relationship with that younger part of you. It means learning to listen to them, to validate their feelings, and to give them, as an adult, everything they needed and never got.

This isn’t about blaming your parents or dwelling on the past. It’s about understanding the root cause of your suffering so you can finally heal it.

In your workbook today, we’re going to start this process. You’ll do a simple visualization to connect with your inner child. This can be emotional. Be gentle with yourself. The goal is simply to say hello. To let that part of you know that you see them, and you’re ready to listen.

This is the beginning of a profound journey. Let’s take the first step together.

### Video 3.2: Reparenting Yourself (13 minutes)

**(Scene: Shaun, speaking with a nurturing and encouraging tone.)**

**Shaun:** Yesterday, we met our inner child. Today, we begin the work of healing them. And we do that through a process called ‘reparenting.’

Reparenting simply means giving yourself, as an adult, what you needed and didn’t get as a child.

Maybe you didn’t get safety, so you create a safe home environment and set firm boundaries. Maybe you didn’t get validation, so you learn to validate your own feelings instead of dismissing them. Maybe you didn’t get unconditional love, so you practice self-compassion. Maybe you didn’t get permission to play, so you schedule time for fun and creativity.

You cannot change the past. You cannot go back and get a different childhood. But you can, right here, right now, start to give that wounded part of you the love, support, and safety it has always craved.

This is the ultimate act of self-care. It’s taking responsibility for your own healing.

Reparenting, in practice, looks like a thousand small things. It’s the way you talk to yourself when you make a mistake. It’s the way you comfort yourself when you’re scared or sad. It’s the way you celebrate your own successes. It’s the way you nourish your body with healthy food and rest. It’s the way you protect yourself from people and situations that are harmful.

It feels awkward at first. It can feel silly to talk to yourself in a kind, parental voice. But it is one of the most powerful things you can do to heal the root of your addiction.

Your addiction was a coping mechanism for a child who was in pain. When you learn to care for that child, the need for the coping mechanism begins to fade.

In your workbook for Day 10, you’ll find an exercise to identify what you needed as a child and how you can start to provide that for yourself today. This isn’t about blame; it’s about empowerment.

You have the power to heal yourself. You have the power to be the parent you always needed. Let’s start today.

### Video 3.3: Healing Childhood Wounds (14 minutes)

**(Scene: Shaun, speaking with a serious, grounded tone. He may mention the need for professional support.)**

**Shaun:** Most of us who struggle with addiction are carrying wounds from our childhood. Not all of us, but most.

These wounds can be from overt trauma—physical, emotional, or sexual abuse. Or they can be from more subtle things, like neglect, abandonment, or growing up in a home where it wasn’t safe to have feelings.

For me, it was the emotional abandonment I felt after my parents’ divorce. It was the feeling that I wasn’t enough to make them stay together. It was the chaos and instability of my home life. I buried that pain for 30 years. And then I drank to keep it buried.

Healing from my addiction, true healing, meant I had to go back and face that pain. I had to acknowledge the wounds. I had to grieve the childhood I didn’t get.

And I couldn’t do it alone. I needed a therapist. I needed a safe space to process the anger, the sadness, and the fear that I had been running from my whole life. I did therapies like EMDR and Internal Family Systems, which are designed specifically to heal trauma.

It was the hardest thing I have ever done. And it was the most important.

**You cannot heal what you don’t acknowledge.**

I want to be very clear here: this course is not a substitute for therapy. If you have significant childhood trauma, I strongly, strongly encourage you to seek professional help. A good trauma therapist can guide you through this process safely.

But the work we do here can be a powerful supplement to that, or a starting point. Your workbook for Day 11 is a space for you to begin to gently and honestly acknowledge the wounds you’re carrying. Not to dwell in them, but to name them. To bring them into the light.

Because the moment you acknowledge a wound, you take away its power to control you from the shadows. You begin the process of taking your power back.

This is brave work. Be gentle with yourself. And please, if it feels like too much, reach out for support.

---
### Video 3.4: Integration and Wholeness (12 minutes)

**(Scene: Shaun, with a sense of peace and integration. He speaks calmly and confidently.)**

**Shaun:** We’ve spent this week on some heavy, deep work. We’ve met our inner child, we’ve talked about reparenting, and we’ve acknowledged our childhood wounds. Now, we need to talk about how to put it all together. We need to talk about integration and wholeness.

Healing is not about getting rid of the parts of you that you don’t like. It’s not about banishing the wounded child or killing the addict. It’s about bringing all the parts of yourself home. It’s about becoming whole.

Wholeness means you can hold all of it. You can hold the pain of your past and the hope for your future. You can hold your shame and your self-compassion. You can acknowledge the part of you that is still a wounded child, and you can step into your power as a healing adult.

It means accepting your past without being defined by it. It means saying: ‘Yes, I was broken. Yes, I did terrible things. Yes, I hurt people. *And* I am healing. I am growing. I am learning. I am becoming whole.’

It’s not about erasing the past. It’s about integrating it into your story in a way that gives it meaning and purpose.

You are not your addiction. But your experience with addiction is a part of you. It has given you a depth, a resilience, and an empathy that you would not have otherwise. The goal is not to pretend it didn’t happen, but to use it as a source of strength and wisdom.

In your workbook for Day 12, you’ll do an exercise to acknowledge all the different parts of yourself—the good, the bad, and the ugly. The wounded child, the addict, the person in recovery, the parent, the friend, the professional.

They are all a part of you. And they are all welcome. Wholeness is not about being perfect. It’s about being able to embrace all of who you are, with honesty and with love.

You are not broken. You are healing. And you are whole.

## Module 4: The Body and Somatic Healing

### Video 4.1: The Body Keeps the Score (15 minutes)

**(Scene: Shaun, standing or sitting in a way that conveys a sense of being grounded in his body.)**

**Shaun:** Welcome to Module 4. This week, we’re shifting our focus from the mind to the body. Because here is a fundamental truth of healing that I had to learn the hard way: **trauma doesn’t just live in your memories. It lives in your body.**

For years, I thought recovery was just a mental game. I thought if I could just change my thinking, I’d be fine. I did talk therapy. I read the books. I understood my issues intellectually. But I still felt like a walking, talking exposed nerve. I was anxious all the time. I couldn’t relax. My heart would race for no reason. I felt disconnected from my body.

And I kept relapsing.

It wasn’t until I read the book ‘The Body Keeps the Score’ by Dr. Bessel van der Kolk that I understood why. Trauma is not an event that happened in the past. It is the *imprint* that event leaves on your mind, brain, and body.

When you experience a threat, your nervous system goes into survival mode—fight, flight, or freeze. It floods your body with stress hormones. And if that threat is overwhelming or you can’t escape, that survival energy gets trapped in your body. Your nervous system gets stuck in the “on” position.

That’s why you feel anxious for no reason. That’s why you’re hypervigilant, always scanning for danger. That’s why you have chronic pain, or digestive issues, or autoimmune problems. That’s why you need a substance to artificially calm your nervous system down.

Talk therapy is essential. But it is not enough. You have to release the trauma from your body.

This is what we call somatic healing. ‘Soma’ is the Greek word for body. Somatic healing is body-based healing. It’s about learning to listen to your body, to work with its sensations, and to release the trapped survival energy.

This week, we’re going to explore practices like breathwork, movement, and mindfulness that help you do just that. This is the missing piece for so many people in recovery.

Your body has been keeping the score. It’s time to learn its language and give it what it needs to finally feel safe.

---
### Video 4.2: Calming Your Nervous System with Breathwork (13 minutes)

**(Scene: Shaun, demonstrating a calm and centered demeanor. He might model the breathing exercise.)**

**Shaun:** Your nervous system has two main gears. The sympathetic nervous system is your gas pedal—it’s your ‘fight or flight’ response. It gets you ready for action. The parasympathetic nervous system is your brake pedal—it’s your ‘rest and digest’ response. It helps you calm down, relax, and heal.

When you’ve experienced trauma and addiction, your gas pedal is often stuck to the floor. You’re living in a state of chronic sympathetic activation. You’re anxious, on edge, irritable, reactive. And in that state, the urge to use a substance to slam on the brakes is overwhelming.

But what if you had a way to manually, consciously, apply the brakes yourself? You do. It’s your breath.

Your breath is the remote control for your nervous system. By changing the rhythm and pace of your breathing, you can directly influence your physiological state. Specifically, long, slow exhales signal to your brain and body that you are safe. They activate your parasympathetic nervous system.

This isn’t woo-woo stuff. This is hard science. It’s one of the most powerful, accessible, and free tools you have for managing cravings, anxiety, and emotional overwhelm.

There are many different breathwork techniques, but we’re going to start with one of the simplest and most effective: Box Breathing.

It’s simple. You inhale for a count of four. You hold your breath for a count of four. You exhale for a count of four. And you hold your breath out for a count of four. That’s one box. You do this for a few minutes, and you will feel a shift.

In your workbook for Day 14, you’ll find instructions for Box Breathing and another powerful technique called 4-7-8 breathing. I want you to practice them. Not just when you’re stressed, but every day. Think of it as doing reps for your nervous system.

The more you practice regulating yourself with your breath when you’re calm, the easier it will be to use that tool when a storm hits.

Your breath is your anchor. Learn to use it.

### Video 4.3: Moving Trauma Out of Your Body (14 minutes)

**(Scene: Shaun, perhaps in a space that allows for movement, like a gym or open room.)**

**Shaun:** As we’ve discussed, trauma gets stuck in the body. It’s trapped energy. And if breathwork is one way to help regulate that energy, movement is how we release it.

Think about an animal in the wild. If a deer is chased by a predator and escapes, what does it do? It doesn’t go back to grazing. It shakes. It trembles. It discharges all of that survival energy from its body. And then, it goes back to grazing.

As humans, we’ve been socialized to suppress that natural response. We’re told to ‘keep it together,’ to ‘be strong,’ to not show our fear. So that energy gets locked in our muscles, in our tissues, in our nervous system.

Movement is the key to unlocking it.

This doesn’t have to mean running a marathon or becoming a bodybuilder, unless that’s what you enjoy. It can be as simple as walking, stretching, yoga, dancing in your living room, or even just standing up and shaking your body for a few minutes, like that deer.

For me, lifting heavy weights is a huge part of my recovery. It’s a way for me to release anger, frustration, and stress in a healthy way. It gets me out of my head and into my body. It helps me feel strong and capable.

For you, it might be something different. The key is to find a form of movement that you enjoy, and to do it consistently. To make it a non-negotiable part of your recovery.

In your workbook, you’ll find a list of different types of movement to explore. I want you to experiment. Get curious. What does your body want to do? What feels good? What helps you feel more present, more grounded, more alive?

Trauma makes us feel disconnected from our bodies. Movement is how we come home. It’s how we reclaim our bodies as a safe and powerful place to live.

So, get up. Move. And let your body do what it was designed to do: heal.

### Video 4.4: Healing Trauma at the Root with EMDR (14 minutes)

**(Scene: Shaun, speaking with conviction and a strong recommendation.)**

**Shaun:** The somatic practices we’ve talked about this week—breathwork, movement, mindfulness—are powerful tools for managing the symptoms of trauma. They help regulate your nervous system in the present moment.

But to truly heal, you have to go to the root. You have to process the traumatic memories themselves. And for that, for many of us, we need professional help. We need trauma therapy.

And I want to talk about one specific therapy that absolutely changed my life: EMDR.

EMDR stands for Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing. It’s a bit of a mouthful, but it’s a revolutionary therapy that is one of the most effective treatments we have for PTSD and trauma.

In an EMDR session, a therapist guides you to focus on a traumatic memory while also engaging in what’s called bilateral stimulation—typically, following the therapist’s fingers with your eyes as they move back and forth. This bilateral stimulation seems to unlock the brain’s natural information processing system, allowing you to process the traumatic memory in a way that it is no longer emotionally charged.

It sounds weird. I thought it sounded weird. But the research is overwhelming, and my personal experience is that it works. I processed my childhood wounds, my shame, my fear—things I had been carrying for 30 years—and I was able to let them go. The memories are still there, but the pain is gone.

EMDR is not the only option. Other powerful trauma therapies include Internal Family Systems (IFS), Somatic Experiencing, and Brainspotting.

But here’s the bottom line: if you have significant trauma in your past, talk therapy alone is probably not enough. You need a therapy that works with the body and the brain to process the trauma at a neurological level.

This is not a sign of weakness. It is a sign of courage. It is the bravest thing you can do.

In your workbook, you’ll find resources to help you find a qualified trauma therapist in your area. Please, I am urging you, if you know you have trauma that you haven’t dealt with, make the call. Do the deep work. It will change everything.
