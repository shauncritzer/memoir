## Module 1: The Foundation - Understanding Your Story
**Days 1-4**

### Introduction

Recovery begins with understanding your story—not the sanitized version you tell at parties, but the raw, honest truth about how you got here.

In this module, you'll map your addiction timeline, identify the trauma that preceded it, and begin to see the connections between your past and your present.

### Core Teaching: The Trauma-Addiction Connection

Addiction is not a moral failing. It's a survival strategy.

When we experience trauma—especially in childhood—our brains learn to cope through avoidance, numbing, and escape. Substances become the most effective tool for managing unbearable emotions.

**The progression looks like this:**

1. **Trauma occurs** (abuse, neglect, loss, violence)
2. **Emotions become overwhelming** (shame, fear, rage, grief)
3. **Coping mechanisms develop** (dissociation, people-pleasing, perfectionism)
4. **Substances are introduced** (immediate relief, powerful reinforcement)
5. **Addiction takes hold** (the solution becomes the problem)

Understanding this progression doesn't excuse your behavior, but it does explain it. And explanation is the first step toward healing.

### Exercise 1: Your Addiction Timeline

Create a timeline of your addiction from first use to rock bottom. For each major event, note:
- **What happened:** (DUI, lost job, relationship ended, etc.)
- **What you were feeling:** (shame, anger, loneliness, etc.)
- **What trauma it connected to:** (childhood abuse, abandonment, etc.)

**Example:**

| Age | Event | Feelings | Trauma Connection |
|-----|-------|----------|-------------------|
| 15 | First drink at party | Relief, belonging | Felt invisible at home |
| 22 | First DUI | Shame, fear | Father's alcoholism |
| 28 | Lost custody of kids | Devastation, self-hatred | My own abandonment as a child |

**Your timeline:**

## Module 2: The Body Keeps the Score - Somatic Healing
**Days 5-8**

### Introduction

Trauma lives in the body. You can talk about your childhood for years in therapy and still feel the panic in your chest, the tension in your shoulders, the knot in your stomach.

This module introduces somatic (body-based) healing practices that help you release trauma stored in your nervous system.

### Core Teaching: Understanding Your Nervous System

Your nervous system has three states:

1. **Ventral Vagal (Safe and Social):** You feel calm, connected, and present
2. **Sympathetic (Fight or Flight):** You feel anxious, angry, or panicked
3. **Dorsal Vagal (Freeze/Shutdown):** You feel numb, dissociated, or depressed

**In addiction, you're constantly cycling between fight/flight and freeze:**
- Using substances to escape fight/flight (anxiety, anger)
- Using substances to escape freeze (depression, numbness)
- Never learning to regulate your nervous system naturally

**Recovery requires learning to:**
- Recognize which state you're in
- Use tools to return to safety and connection
- Build capacity to tolerate difficult emotions without substances

### Exercise 1: Nervous System Check-In

**Right now, which state are you in?**

□ Safe and Social (calm, present, connected)  
□ Fight or Flight (anxious, angry, restless)  
□ Freeze/Shutdown (numb, disconnected, depressed)

**What sensations do you notice in your body?**

□ Tight chest  
□ Shallow breathing  
□ Clenched jaw  
□ Tense shoulders  
□ Knot in stomach  
□ Numbness  
□ Other: _________________________________________________

### Exercise 2: Grounding Techniques

**When you're in fight/flight or freeze, use these tools to return to safety:**

**5-4-3-2-1 Grounding:**
- Name 5 things you can see
- Name 4 things you can touch
- Name 3 things you can hear
- Name 2 things you can smell
- Name 1 thing you can taste

**Box Breathing:**
- Breathe in for 4 counts
- Hold for 4 counts
- Breathe out for 4 counts
- Hold for 4 counts
- Repeat 5 times

**Bilateral Stimulation (EMDR-inspired):**
- Tap alternating knees or shoulders
- Or cross arms and tap alternating biceps
- Continue for 2-3 minutes while thinking of a safe place

**Practice one grounding technique right now. How do you feel after?**
_________________________________________________________________

### Exercise 3: Building a Somatic Toolkit

What body-based practices help you feel safe and regulated?

**Check all that apply (and commit to trying at least 3 this week):**

□ Yoga  
□ Walking in nature  
□ Dancing  
□ Cold showers  
□ Progressive muscle relaxation  
□ Massage or bodywork  
□ Stretching  
□ Deep breathing exercises  
□ Humming or singing  
□ Other: _________________________________________________

### Reflection Questions

1. What did you notice about your nervous system state today?
2. Which grounding technique worked best for you?
3. How does it feel to pay attention to your body instead of numbing it?

### Module 2 Affirmation

*"My body is not my enemy. It's been trying to protect me. I am learning to listen to it and care for it."*

## Module 3: The Inner Child - Healing Childhood Wounds
**Days 9-12**

### Introduction

Much of your addiction stems from wounds inflicted in childhood. The child you were—the one who was hurt, neglected, or abandoned—is still inside you, carrying that pain.

This module guides you through inner child work, a powerful therapeutic approach that helps you heal those early wounds.

### Core Teaching: Meeting Your Inner Child

Your inner child is not a metaphor. It's the part of you that still feels the fear, shame, and loneliness of childhood.

**When your inner child is wounded and unhealed:**
- You react to adult situations with childlike emotions (rage, terror, shame)
- You seek external validation to fill the void left by childhood neglect
- You use substances to numb the pain that child is still carrying

**When you heal your inner child:**
- You can respond to situations with adult wisdom instead of childlike reactivity
- You can give yourself the love and validation you didn't receive
- You no longer need substances to escape that child's pain

### Exercise 1: Visualizing Your Inner Child

**Find a quiet space. Close your eyes. Take three deep breaths.**

**Now visualize yourself as a child—whatever age feels right. Ask yourself:**

- How old am I?
- What am I wearing?
- Where am I?
- What expression is on my face?
- What do I need right now?

**Write what you saw:**
_________________________________________________________________
_________________________________________________________________
_________________________________________________________________

### Exercise 2: A Letter to Your Inner Child

**Write a letter to your younger self. Tell them what they needed to hear.**

**Example:**

*Dear 8-year-old Shaun,*

*I know you're scared. I know you feel alone. I know you think it's your fault that Dad drinks and Mom is always angry. But it's not. You are not responsible for their pain. You are a good kid. You are worthy of love. I'm here now, and I will protect you.*

**Your letter:**

Dear ________-year-old me,

_________________________________________________________________
_________________________________________________________________
_________________________________________________________________
_________________________________________________________________
_________________________________________________________________

### Exercise 3: Reparenting Yourself

**What did your inner child need but didn't receive?**

**Check all that apply:**

□ Safety and protection  
□ Unconditional love  
□ Validation of feelings  
□ Healthy boundaries  
□ Encouragement and praise  
□ Physical affection  
□ Consistency and stability  
□ Permission to play and have fun  
□ Other: _________________________________________________

**How can you give your inner child what they need now?**

**Example:** *My inner child needed validation. I can validate myself by journaling my feelings without judgment.*

**My plan:**
_________________________________________________________________
_________________________________________________________________
_________________________________________________________________

### Reflection Questions

1. What emotions came up when you visualized your inner child?
2. What was it like to write a letter to your younger self?
3. How can you practice reparenting yourself this week?

### Module 3 Affirmation

*"The child I was deserved better. The adult I am can give them what they need. I am healing from the inside out."*

## Module 4: Shame and Self-Forgiveness
**Days 13-16**

### Introduction

Shame is the voice that says, "I am bad." Guilt says, "I did something bad." Shame is toxic. It keeps you stuck in cycles of self-hatred and self-sabotage.

This module helps you distinguish between shame and guilt, process both, and practice radical self-forgiveness.

### Core Teaching: The Difference Between Shame and Guilt

**Guilt:** "I made a mistake."  
**Shame:** "I am a mistake."

**Guilt is productive.** It motivates you to make amends and change behavior.

**Shame is destructive.** It convinces you that you're fundamentally broken and unworthy of love.

**In addiction, shame becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy:**
- You feel shame about your behavior
- Shame makes you feel worthless
- Feeling worthless makes you use
- Using creates more shame
- The cycle continues

**Breaking the shame cycle requires:**
- Naming the shame
- Sharing it with safe people (shame dies in the light)
- Separating your worth from your behavior
- Practicing self-compassion

### Exercise 1: Shame Inventory

**What are you most ashamed of from your addiction?**

**Write it down. All of it. No one else needs to see this.**

1. _____________________________________________________________
2. _____________________________________________________________
3. _____________________________________________________________
4. _____________________________________________________________
5. _____________________________________________________________

**Now read this out loud:**

*"I am not my worst moments. I am not the sum of my mistakes. I am a human being who was sick and is now healing. I am worthy of love and forgiveness."*

### Exercise 2: Self-Compassion Practice

**For each item on your shame list, rewrite it with self-compassion:**

**Example:**

**Shame statement:** "I'm a terrible father. I abandoned my kids."

**Self-compassion reframe:** "I was sick with addiction and couldn't show up for my kids the way they deserved. That was a consequence of my disease, not a reflection of my love for them. I am working to make amends and be the father they need now."

**Your reframes:**

1. _____________________________________________________________
2. _____________________________________________________________
3. _____________________________________________________________

### Exercise 3: The Forgiveness Letter

**Write a letter of forgiveness to yourself.**

**Example:**

*Dear Shaun,*

*I forgive you for the lies, the broken promises, the people you hurt. I forgive you for the years you wasted, the opportunities you destroyed, the pain you caused. You were doing the best you could with the tools you had. You are not that person anymore. You are healing. You are trying. That is enough.*

**Your letter:**

Dear _______________,

_________________________________________________________________
_________________________________________________________________
_________________________________________________________________
_________________________________________________________________

### Reflection Questions

1. What was it like to write down your shame?
2. How did it feel to practice self-compassion?
3. Do you believe you deserve forgiveness? Why or why not?

### Module 4 Affirmation

*"I am not defined by my past. I am defined by who I'm becoming. I forgive myself and I am worthy of a new beginning."*

---

## Module 5: Rebuilding Relationships and Trust
**Days 17-20**

### Introduction

Addiction destroys relationships. You've lied, manipulated, broken promises, and hurt the people who love you.

This module addresses how to rebuild trust, make amends, and create healthy relationships in recovery.

### Core Teaching: Trust is Earned, Not Demanded

**You cannot expect people to trust you just because you're sober now.**

Trust is rebuilt through:
- Consistent behavior over time
- Radical honesty
- Following through on commitments
- Respecting boundaries
- Making amends without expecting forgiveness

**Some relationships will heal. Some won't. And that's okay.**

Your job is to do the work of making amends and becoming trustworthy. Their job is to decide if they want to let you back in.

### Exercise 1: Relationship Inventory

**Who did your addiction hurt?**

**List the people and the harm you caused:**

| Person | Relationship | Harm I Caused |
|--------|--------------|---------------|
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |

### Exercise 2: Amends Planning

**For each person above, answer these questions:**

**Person:** _______________________________________________

**What I want to say:**
_________________________________________________________________
_________________________________________________________________

**Is direct contact appropriate, or would it cause more harm?**
□ Direct amends is appropriate  
□ Living amends (changed behavior) is better  
□ Not sure—need to discuss with sponsor/therapist

**What does my sponsor/therapist say?**
_________________________________________________________________

### Exercise 3: Building New Relationships

**What qualities do I want in my relationships now?**

**Check all that apply:**

□ Honesty  
□ Mutual respect  
□ Healthy boundaries  
□ Emotional safety  
□ Accountability  
□ Shared values  
□ Support for my recovery  
□ Other: _________________________________________________

**Who in my life embodies these qualities?**
_________________________________________________________________

**How can I invest more in these relationships?**
_________________________________________________________________

### Reflection Questions

1. What's the hardest part of rebuilding trust?
2. Who do you most want to make amends to?
3. What would healthy relationships look like for you?

### Module 5 Affirmation

*"I cannot undo the past, but I can build a different future. I am becoming someone worthy of trust."*

## Module 6: Finding Meaning and Purpose
**Days 21-24**

### Introduction

Recovery is not just about not using. It's about building a life so good you don't want to escape from it.

This module helps you discover meaning, purpose, and values that will sustain your recovery long-term.

### Core Teaching: The Three Questions

**To build a meaningful life in recovery, answer these three questions:**

1. **What do I value?** (What matters most to me?)

## Module 7: Spiritual Awakening and Connection

This module explores spiritual practices that support recovery, regardless of your beliefs.

### Core Teaching: The God-Shaped Hole

Many people in recovery talk about a "God-shaped hole"—a deep longing for connection, meaning, and transcendence that substances temporarily filled.

**Spirituality in recovery is about:**
- Surrendering control
- Trusting a process bigger than yourself
- Finding connection and belonging
- Experiencing awe, gratitude, and wonder
- Aligning with values and purpose

**You don't need to believe in God. But you do need to believe in something beyond your own willpower.**
