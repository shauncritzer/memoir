# The REWIRED 7-Day Reset
## A Journey to Reclaim Your Nervous System and Your Life

### By Shaun Critzer

## Introduction: This is Not Another 7-Day Challenge

This is a reset. A recalibration. A reclamation.

For years, your nervous system has been hijacked by addiction, trauma, and stress. You're living in a constant state of fight, flight, or freeze. You're exhausted, overwhelmed, and disconnected.

This 7-day reset is designed to change that.

We're not just talking about not using. We're talking about rewiring your brain and body for safety, connection, and resilience. We're using the REWIRED methodology—a trauma-informed approach to recovery that goes beyond willpower and addresses the root cause of addiction: a dysregulated nervous system.

Each day, we'll focus on one letter of the REWIRED framework. You'll learn practical tools to calm your nervous system, process your emotions, and build a life you don't need to escape from.

This is not a magic bullet. It's the beginning of a journey. But if you commit to these 7 days, you will feel a shift. You will feel more grounded, more present, and more hopeful.

Let's begin.

# Day 1: R - RECOGNIZE

**Today's Focus:** Recognize the patterns, triggers, and rock bottom moments that brought you here. Honesty without judgment.

---

### Morning Reflection (10 minutes)

**What patterns have been running your life?** (e.g., drinking after work, using when lonely, fighting with partner)

_________________________________________________________________
_________________________________________________________________

**What are your top 3 triggers?** (e.g., stress, boredom, social anxiety)

1. _____________________________________________________________
2. _____________________________________________________________
3. _____________________________________________________________

**Describe your rock bottom moment. What did it feel like?**

_________________________________________________________________
_________________________________________________________________

> **Did You Know?**
> Rock bottom isn't a place of failure; it's a moment of clarity. It's the point where the pain of staying the same finally outweighs the fear of change. Your rock bottom is not your shame; it's your foundation.

### Daily Practice: The 3-Minute Breathing Space

**Do this anytime you feel overwhelmed or triggered today.**

1.  **Acknowledge:** Notice what's happening. "I'm feeling anxious." "I'm having a craving."
2.  **Gather:** Bring your attention to your breath. Feel the sensation of the air entering and leaving your body. Anchor yourself in the present moment.
3.  **Expand:** Expand your awareness to your whole body. Feel your feet on the floor, your hands in your lap. Notice the space around you.

This simple practice interrupts the autopilot of addiction and brings you back to the present moment, where you have a choice.

> "Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate." - Carl Jung

---

# Day 2: E - ESTABLISH

**Today's Focus:** Establish safety and support. Addiction thrives in isolation; recovery happens in connection.

---

### Morning Reflection (10 minutes)

**Who are the safe people in your life?** (People who support your recovery, listen without judgment, and make you feel seen)

_________________________________________________________________

**Who are the unsafe people?** (People who trigger you, enable you, or drain your energy)

_________________________________________________________________

**What does a safe space look like for you?** (e.g., your home, a coffee shop, a nature trail)

_________________________________________________________________

> **Did You Know?**
> Safety is not the absence of threat; it's the presence of connection. Our nervous systems are wired to co-regulate with others. When we feel safe and connected, our brains literally calm down, reducing cravings and anxiety.

---

### Daily Practice: The 5-4-3-2-1 Grounding Technique

**Use this when you feel dissociated or anxious.**

- **5:** Name 5 things you can see.
- **4:** Name 4 things you can feel (e.g., your feet on the floor, the texture of your shirt).
- **3:** Name 3 things you can hear.
- **2:** Name 2 things you can smell.
- **1:** Name 1 thing you can taste.

This technique brings you back into your body and into the present moment, interrupting the spiral of anxious thoughts.

---

### Evening Journal (15 minutes)

**Who did you connect with today? How did it feel?**

_________________________________________________________________

**What boundaries do you need to set with unsafe people?**

_________________________________________________________________

**How can you create more safety in your daily life?**

_________________________________________________________________

> **Quote of the Day:**
> "Connection is the opposite of addiction." - Johann Hari

---

# Day 3: W - WORK

**Today's Focus:** Work with your triggers, not against them. Triggers are not your enemy; they are messengers.

---

### Morning Reflection (10 minutes)

**What emotions are you most afraid to feel?** (e.g., anger, sadness, shame, fear)

_________________________________________________________________

**How do you typically deal with these emotions?** (e.g., numb, distract, lash out)

_________________________________________________________________

**What if these emotions were just energy in your body, trying to move?**

_________________________________________________________________

> **Did You Know?**
> Emotions are physiological events in the body that last about 90 seconds. It's the stories we tell ourselves about the emotions that make them last for hours or days. By learning to stay with the physical sensation, we can let emotions move through us without getting stuck.

---

### Daily Practice: RAIN on a Trigger

**When a trigger or difficult emotion arises, practice RAIN:**

- **R - Recognize:** "Ah, this is anxiety." "This is a craving."
- **A - Allow:** Allow the feeling to be there, without judgment. Don't try to fix it or push it away.
- **I - Investigate:** Get curious. Where do you feel it in your body? What does it feel like? What does it need?
- **N - Nurture:** Offer yourself some compassion. Place a hand on your heart. Say, "This is hard. I'm here for you."

RAIN is a practice of self-compassion that rewires your response to triggers.

---

### Evening Journal (15 minutes)

**What triggers did you work with today?**

_________________________________________________________________

**What did you learn from them?**

_________________________________________________________________

**How did it feel to investigate your emotions instead of running from them?**

_________________________________________________________________

> **Quote of the Day:**
> "The cave you fear to enter holds the treasure you seek." - Joseph Campbell

---

# Day 4: I - INTEGRATE

**Today's Focus:** Integrate healthy routines and structure. Your nervous system loves predictability.

---

### Morning Reflection (10 minutes)

**What does your ideal morning routine look like?** (e.g., wake up, meditate, journal, exercise, healthy breakfast)

_________________________________________________________________

**What does your ideal evening routine look like?** (e.g., no screens, read, connect with partner, gratitude list)

_________________________________________________________________

**What's one small change you can make to your routine today?**

_________________________________________________________________

> **Did You Know?**
> Routines and rituals create a sense of safety and predictability for your nervous system. When your brain knows what to expect, it can relax out of a hypervigilant state, reducing anxiety and freeing up energy for healing and growth.

---

### Daily Practice: The 1% Rule

**Don't try to change everything at once. Just get 1% better every day.**

- Drink one more glass of water.
- Go for a 5-minute walk.
- Read one page of a book.
- Write one sentence in your journal.

Small, consistent actions are more powerful than big, unsustainable changes. What's your 1% for today?

---

### Evening Journal (15 minutes)

**How did your routine (or lack thereof) affect your mood and cravings today?**

_________________________________________________________________

**What's working in your daily structure? What's not?**

_________________________________________________________________

**What's your 1% improvement for tomorrow?**

_________________________________________________________________

> **Quote of the Day:**
> "We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit." - Will Durant

---

# Day 5: R - RELEASE

**Today's Focus:** Release the shame, guilt, and self-judgment that keep you stuck. You are not your past.

---

### Morning Reflection (10 minutes)

**What shame-based stories are you telling yourself?** (e.g., "I'm a failure," "I'm unlovable," "I'm broken")

_________________________________________________________________

**What guilt are you carrying from your past?**

_________________________________________________________________

**If you were to treat yourself with the same compassion you'd give a friend, what would you say?**

_________________________________________________________________

> **Did You Know?**
> Shame is a neurotoxin. It activates the same brain regions as physical pain and keeps your nervous system in a state of threat. Self-compassion, on the other hand, releases oxytocin and opiates—the brain's natural anti-anxiety and feel-good chemicals.

---

### Daily Practice: The Self-Compassion Break

**When you notice self-criticism or shame, try this:**

1.  **Acknowledge the pain:** "This is a moment of suffering."
2.  **Normalize the experience:** "Suffering is a part of life. Other people feel this way too."
3.  **Offer yourself kindness:** Place a hand on your heart and say, "May I be kind to myself. May I give myself the compassion I need."

This practice, developed by Dr. Kristin Neff, is a powerful way to rewire your brain for self-compassion.

**How could you have responded with more self-compassion?**

_________________________________________________________________

**What's one thing you can forgive yourself for today?**

> **Quote of the Day:**
> "Shame dies when stories are told in safe places." - Ann Voskamp

---

# Day 6: E - EMBRACE

**Today's Focus:** Embrace your resilience, your strengths, and your new identity. You are more than your addiction.

---

### Morning Reflection (10 minutes)

**What are 3 things you're proud of in your recovery so far?**

1. _____________________________________________________________
2. _____________________________________________________________
3. _____________________________________________________________

**What strengths have you discovered in yourself through this process?** (e.g., courage, honesty, perseverance)

_________________________________________________________________

**Who are you becoming?**

_________________________________________________________________

> **Did You Know?**
> Post-traumatic growth is a real phenomenon. Studies show that many people who experience trauma and addiction report positive changes in their lives, including a greater appreciation for life, improved relationships, a sense of personal strength, and spiritual development.

---

### Daily Practice: The "I Am" List

**Write down 10 "I am" statements that reflect your new identity.**

- I am resilient.
- I am a person who keeps promises.
- I am worthy of love and connection.
- I am more than my past.
- I am a work in progress.

1. I am ________________________________________________________
2. I am ________________________________________________________
3. I am ________________________________________________________
4. I am ________________________________________________________
5. I am ________________________________________________________
6. I am ________________________________________________________
7. I am ________________________________________________________
8. I am ________________________________________________________
9. I am ________________________________________________________
10. I am _______________________________________________________

Read this list aloud to yourself. Feel the truth of it in your body.

---

# Day 7: D - DEVELOP

**Today's Focus:** Develop your vision for the future. What are you staying sober for?

---

### Morning Reflection (10 minutes)

**If you knew you couldn't fail, what would you do with your life?**

_________________________________________________________________

**What brings you joy, meaning, and purpose?**

_________________________________________________________________

**What's one small step you can take toward that vision today?**

_________________________________________________________________

> **Did You Know?**
> Having a sense of purpose is a powerful predictor of long-term recovery. When you have a reason to get up in the morning—something bigger than yourself to live for—cravings and triggers lose their power.

---

### Daily Practice: The Future Self Visualization

**Close your eyes for 5 minutes. Imagine yourself one year from now, thriving in recovery.**

- What do you look like?
- How do you feel in your body?
- Who are you with?
- What are you doing with your days?
- What are you proud of?

Feel the emotions of this future self. Let this vision pull you forward.

---

### Evening Journal (15 minutes)

**What did you do today to move toward your vision?**

_________________________________________________________________

**What obstacles are in your way? How can you overcome them?**

_________________________________________________________________

**What are you most excited about for your future?**
