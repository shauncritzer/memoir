# The REWIRED Relief Toolkit

**A Crisis-Focused Guide to Regulating Your Nervous System**

---

When you’re in the middle of a craving, an emotional flashback, or intense anxiety, you don’t need a lecture. You need relief. This toolkit is designed to give you just that: simple, powerful, body-based tools to help you find your ground when you feel like you’re losing it.

## 1. The 5-4-3-2-1 Grounding Technique

When you’re stuck in your head, lost in a spiral of anxious thoughts, you need to get back into your body and into the present moment. This technique uses your five senses to do just that.

**Instructions:**

Wherever you are, pause and gently notice:

*   **5 things you can see:** Look around you. Name five things. A lamp. A crack in the ceiling. The color of your socks. Don’t just glance; really see them.
*   **4 things you can feel:** Notice the physical sensations. The feeling of your feet on the floor. The texture of your shirt. The temperature of the air on your skin. The weight of your phone in your hand.
*   **3 things you can hear:** Listen. The hum of the refrigerator. A car passing by. The sound of your own breathing. Tune into the sounds around you.
*   **2 things you can smell:** What do you smell? The coffee on your desk? The soap on your hands? If you can’t smell anything, imagine two smells you enjoy.
*   **1 thing you can taste:** What is the taste in your mouth? Take a sip of water. Pop a mint in your mouth. Just notice.

**Why it works:** This technique pulls your attention out of the abstract world of your thoughts and anchors you in the concrete reality of the present moment. It tells your nervous system, “Right here, right now, you are safe.”

## 2. Box Breathing

This is a classic breathwork technique used by Navy SEALs, athletes, and first responders to calm the nervous system and improve focus under pressure.

**Instructions:**

1.  **Inhale** through your nose for a slow count of **4**.
2.  **Hold** your breath for a count of **4**.
3.  **Exhale** slowly through your mouth for a count of **4**.
4.  **Hold** your breath out for a count of **4**.
5.  Repeat for 1-5 minutes.

**Why it works:** The slow, rhythmic nature of this breath, combined with the holds, balances your nervous system. It shifts you out of the anxious “fight or flight” state and into the calm “rest and digest” state.

## 3. The RAIN Practice for Working with Triggers

When a difficult emotion or craving arises, our instinct is to either fight it or run from it. The RAIN practice, developed by meditation teacher Michele McDonald, offers a third option: mindful investigation.

**Instructions:**

*   **R - Recognize:** Simply notice what is happening inside you. Say to yourself, “I’m feeling a strong craving,” or “This is anxiety.” You are naming it without judgment.
*   **A - Allow:** Allow the feeling to be there. Don’t try to fix it, change it, or push it away. Give it permission to exist. This simple act of allowing can release a huge amount of resistance and struggle.
*   **I - Investigate:** Get curious. What does this feeling actually feel like in your body? Is it a tightness in your chest? A knot in your stomach? A buzzing energy? Where is it located? Does it change? You are not investigating the story *about* the feeling, but the raw physical sensation of it.
*   **N - Nurture:** Offer yourself some kindness. Place a hand on your heart. Say something like, “This is hard. It’s okay. I’m here with you.” You are bringing compassion to your pain.

**Why it works:** RAIN teaches you to stop being at war with your inner world. It shows you that you can be with difficult emotions without being consumed by them, and that your compassionate presence is the most powerful healing force you have.
