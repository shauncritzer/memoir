### Video 1: Why Your Nervous System Is Running the Show

**Duration:** 10-12 minutes  
**Tone:** Compassionate, educational, hopeful  
**Delivery:** Warm, personal, like talking to a friend

---

**SCRIPT:**

Hey, I'm Shaun Critzer. I've been sober for 13 years, and today I want to talk about something that changed everything for me—understanding that my nervous system was running the show the whole time.

For years, I thought addiction was a moral failing. I thought I just needed more willpower, more discipline, more strength. But here's what I learned: addiction isn't a character defect. It's your nervous system trying to survive.

Let me explain.

When you grow up with trauma—whether that's abuse, neglect, chaos, or just feeling fundamentally unsafe—your nervous system gets wired differently. It's like your internal alarm system is stuck on high alert. You're constantly scanning for danger, even when there isn't any.

This isn't your fault. This is biology. This is what happens when a developing brain tries to adapt to an unsafe environment.

So what does your nervous system do? It looks for ways to regulate. Ways to calm down. Ways to feel normal, even if just for a moment.

For me, that was alcohol. Then porn. Then affairs. Then obsessive bodybuilding. I wasn't weak—I was dysregulated.

Dysregulation means your nervous system can't self-soothe. It can't find balance. It swings between hyperarousal—anxiety, panic, rage—and hypoarousal—numbness, depression, shutdown.

And substances or compulsive behaviors? They work. Temporarily. They bring you back to baseline. They quiet the noise. They make you feel human again.

But here's the problem: they don't heal the dysregulation. They just mask it. And over time, you need more and more to get the same effect.

This is why willpower doesn't work. You're not fighting a lack of discipline. You're fighting a nervous system that's trying to survive.

So what's the solution?

First, you have to understand this isn't your fault. You didn't choose to have a dysregulated nervous system. You adapted to survive.

Second, you have to learn new ways to regulate. Somatic practices. Breathwork. Grounding techniques. Therapy. Community. These aren't luxuries—they're necessities.

Third, you have to be patient with yourself. Your nervous system has been wired this way for years, maybe decades. It's going to take time to rewire it.

But here's the good news: it IS possible. Your brain is neuroplastic. It can change. You can heal.

Over the next seven days, we're going to walk through this together. You're going to learn how to recognize dysregulation, how to respond to it, and how to build a life that supports nervous system healing.

You're not broken. You're not weak. You're not a failure.

You're a human being with a nervous system that's been trying to protect you the only way it knows how.

And now, you're going to learn a better way.

Let's do this.

### Video 2: What Trauma Actually Did to Your Body

**Duration:** 10-12 minutes  
**Tone:** Validating, educational, empowering  
**Delivery:** Grounded, clear, reassuring

---

**SCRIPT:**

Welcome back. Yesterday we talked about how your nervous system is running the show. Today, we're going deeper—we're talking about what trauma actually did to your body.

And I want to be clear: when I say trauma, I'm not just talking about the big, obvious stuff. I'm talking about anything that made you feel unsafe, unseen, or unloved as a kid.

Maybe it was overt abuse—physical, sexual, emotional. Maybe it was neglect—being left alone, ignored, or dismissed. Maybe it was chaos—addiction in the home, violence, unpredictability.

Or maybe it was more subtle. Maybe it was a parent who was emotionally unavailable. A sibling who bullied you. A school environment where you never felt like you belonged.

All of these experiences shape your nervous system. And here's what most people don't understand: trauma isn't just a memory. It's stored in your body.

When you experience trauma, especially as a child, your body goes into survival mode. Your sympathetic nervous system kicks in—fight, flight, or freeze.

But here's the problem: if you're a kid, you can't fight. You can't flee. So what do you do? You freeze. You dissociate. You learn to numb out.

And if this happens over and over again—if you're living in a chronic state of threat—your nervous system gets stuck.

You become hypervigilant. You're always scanning for danger. Your heart rate is elevated. Your cortisol levels are through the roof. You can't relax, even when you're safe.

Or you go the opposite direction—you shut down. You dissociate. You feel numb, disconnected, like you're watching your life from the outside.

This is what Dr. Bessel van der Kolk calls "the body keeps the score." Your body remembers the trauma, even if your conscious mind doesn't.

And here's where addiction comes in.

When you use a substance or engage in a compulsive behavior, you're not just chasing a high. You're trying to regulate your nervous system. You're trying to feel normal.

Alcohol calms the hyperarousal. Porn gives you a dopamine hit when you're shut down. Affairs make you feel alive when you've been numb for years.

You're not weak. You're not broken. You're self-medicating a nervous system that's been stuck in survival mode since childhood.

So what do we do about it?

First, we have to acknowledge the trauma. We have to stop minimizing it. "It wasn't that bad." "Other people had it worse." "I should just get over it."

No. Your pain is real. Your trauma is valid. And it's affecting your life right now, today.

Second, we have to learn somatic practices—ways to release trauma from the body. This isn't just talk therapy. This is breathwork, movement, grounding, EMDR, somatic experiencing.

Third, we have to build safety. Your nervous system needs to know it's safe before it can heal. This means boundaries, routines, supportive relationships, and environments where you can let your guard down.

Trauma isn't your fault. But healing is your responsibility.

And the good news? You're already here. You're already doing the work.

Let's keep going.

### Video 3: Why Willpower Fails Every Time

**Duration:** 10-12 minutes  
**Tone:** Honest, relatable, solution-focused  
**Delivery:** Direct, real, no-nonsense

---

**SCRIPT:**

Let's talk about willpower. Specifically, why it fails. Every. Single. Time.

I spent years thinking I just needed to try harder. I needed to be stronger. I needed to white-knuckle my way through cravings and urges and triggers.

And you know what happened? I relapsed. Over and over again.

Because here's the truth: willpower is a finite resource. And when you're dealing with addiction, you're not just fighting a craving—you're fighting a dysregulated nervous system.

Let me break this down.

Willpower lives in your prefrontal cortex—the rational, decision-making part of your brain. This is the part that says, "I know I shouldn't drink. I know this is bad for me. I'm going to make a different choice."

But addiction lives in your limbic system—the emotional, survival-oriented part of your brain. This is the part that says, "I'm in pain. I need relief. NOW."

And when your limbic system is activated—when you're triggered, stressed, or dysregulated—your prefrontal cortex goes offline.

You literally cannot access rational thought in that moment. Your brain is in survival mode.

So what happens? You use. You relapse. You engage in the compulsive behavior.

And then what? Shame. Guilt. Self-loathing. "Why can't I just stop? What's wrong with me?"

Nothing is wrong with you. You're just trying to use a cognitive solution for a nervous system problem.

Here's the other issue with willpower: it gets depleted.

Every decision you make throughout the day—what to eat, what to wear, what to say, how to respond—uses up willpower. It's like a battery that drains over time.

And if you're white-knuckling your way through cravings all day, by the time evening hits, you've got nothing left. That's why most relapses happen at night.

So if willpower doesn't work, what does?

Three things: regulation, routine, and resources.

**Regulation:** You have to learn how to calm your nervous system BEFORE you're triggered. This means daily practices—breathwork, meditation, grounding, movement. You're building nervous system resilience.

**Routine:** You have to remove decision fatigue. Structure your day so you're not constantly making choices. Same wake-up time. Same meals. Same meetings. Same bedtime. Routine creates safety.

**Resources:** You have to have a plan for when cravings hit. Not "I'll just use willpower." But "I'll call my sponsor. I'll go to a meeting. I'll do 10 minutes of breathwork. I'll text my accountability partner."

Willpower is not the answer. Nervous system regulation is.

You're not failing because you're weak. You're failing because you're using the wrong tool.

Let's build a better toolkit.

### Video 4: Somatic Tools That Actually Help

**Duration:** 10-12 minutes  
**Tone:** Practical, empowering, hands-on  
**Delivery:** Instructional, encouraging, actionable

---

**SCRIPT:**

Alright, we've spent three days talking about the problem. Today, we're talking about solutions.

Specifically, somatic tools—body-based practices that help you regulate your nervous system in real time.

These aren't just nice-to-haves. These are essentials. These are the tools that will keep you sober when willpower fails.

Let's start with the most powerful tool you have: your breath.

**Box Breathing:**  
Inhale for 4 counts. Hold for 4 counts. Exhale for 4 counts. Hold for 4 counts. Repeat for 2-3 minutes.

This activates your parasympathetic nervous system—the rest-and-digest response. It tells your body it's safe. It calms the fight-or-flight response.

You can do this anywhere. In your car. At your desk. Before bed. When you feel a craving coming on.

**Grounding:**  
When you're dysregulated, you're often dissociated—disconnected from your body. Grounding brings you back.

5-4-3-2-1 technique: Name 5 things you can see. 4 things you can touch. 3 things you can hear. 2 things you can smell. 1 thing you can taste.

Or just plant your feet on the ground. Feel the weight of your body. Press your hands together. Splash cold water on your face.

The goal is to get out of your head and into your body.

**Movement:**  
Trauma gets stored in the body. Movement releases it.

This doesn't have to be intense. Walk. Stretch. Shake. Dance. Do yoga. Lift weights.

The key is to move with intention. Pay attention to how your body feels. Notice where you're holding tension. Breathe into it.

**Bilateral Stimulation:**  
This is the basis of EMDR therapy. You're activating both hemispheres of your brain to process trauma.

Tap your knees alternately. Cross your arms and tap your shoulders. Walk and focus on the left-right rhythm.

This helps your brain integrate traumatic memories instead of staying stuck in them.

**Cold Exposure:**  
Cold showers, ice baths, or even splashing cold water on your face activates your vagus nerve—the main nerve of your parasympathetic nervous system.

It's an instant nervous system reset. It's uncomfortable, but it works.

**Humming or Singing:**  
This also stimulates the vagus nerve. Hum. Sing. Chant. It sounds weird, but it's incredibly calming.

Here's the key: you have to practice these tools when you're NOT in crisis.

If you only try breathwork when you're in the middle of a craving, it's not going to work. You have to build the skill first.

So here's your assignment: pick one tool. Practice it every day for the next four days. Make it a non-negotiable part of your routine.

Your nervous system is trainable. You just have to train it.

Let's do this.

### Video 5: Process Addictions Are Real Addictions

**Duration:** 10-12 minutes  
**Tone:** Validating, educational, inclusive  
**Delivery:** Compassionate, normalizing, affirming

---

**SCRIPT:**

Let's talk about something that doesn't get enough attention: process addictions.

Most people think of addiction as substances—alcohol, drugs, pills. And yes, those are addictions.

But what about porn? Affairs? Work? Fitness? Bodybuilding? Shopping? Gaming? Social media?

These are process addictions—compulsive behaviors that hijack your brain's reward system the same way substances do.

And here's what I want you to know: they're just as real. They're just as destructive. And they deserve just as much attention.

I didn't just struggle with alcohol. I struggled with porn. With affairs. With obsessive bodybuilding.

And for years, I minimized it. "At least I'm not drinking." "At least I'm not doing drugs." "At least I'm working out—that's healthy, right?"

Wrong.

A compulsive behavior is a compulsive behavior. It doesn't matter if it's socially acceptable. It doesn't matter if it looks productive from the outside.

If you're using it to escape, to numb, to regulate your nervous system—it's an addiction.

Here's how you know:

- You can't stop, even when you want to.
- It's causing problems in your relationships, your work, your health.
- You feel shame, guilt, or secrecy around it.
- You're using it to cope with emotions you don't want to feel.

That's addiction.

And here's why process addictions are so insidious: they're harder to quit than substances.

With alcohol, you can remove it from your life completely. You don't need alcohol to survive.

But you can't quit eating. You can't quit working. You can't quit the internet.

So you have to learn moderation. You have to learn boundaries. You have to learn how to engage with these things in a healthy way.

And that's hard. Really hard.

But it's possible.

Here's what helped me:

**Identify the function:** What is this behavior doing for you? Is it calming anxiety? Numbing pain? Providing connection? Once you know the function, you can find healthier alternatives.

**Set boundaries:** If it's work, set work hours. If it's fitness, set rest days. If it's social media, set screen time limits. Boundaries aren't punishment—they're protection.

**Get support:** Process addictions thrive in secrecy. Bring them into the light. Tell your sponsor. Tell your therapist. Tell your accountability partner.

**Address the root:** Process addictions are symptoms of nervous system dysregulation. You have to heal the trauma underneath.

You're not weak. You're not broken. You're human.

And if you're struggling with a process addiction, you're not alone.

Let's heal this together.

### Video 6: Relapse Isn't Failure, It's Data

**Duration:** 10-12 minutes  
**Tone:** Compassionate, reframing, hopeful  
**Delivery:** Gentle, encouraging, non-judgmental

---

**SCRIPT:**

Let's talk about relapse.

Most people see relapse as failure. As proof that they're not strong enough. As evidence that recovery isn't working.

I see it differently.

Relapse isn't failure. It's data.

Let me explain.

When you relapse, you're not starting over. You're not back at square one. You're learning.

You're learning what your triggers are. You're learning what situations put you at risk. You're learning what tools work and what tools don't.

And that information is invaluable.

Here's the truth: most people relapse. Multiple times. That doesn't mean recovery doesn't work. It means recovery is a process, not an event.

So instead of beating yourself up, ask yourself: what can I learn from this?

- What was I feeling before I used?
- What was happening in my life?
- What warning signs did I ignore?
- What tool could I have used instead?

This is how you build resilience. This is how you get better at recovery.

Now, I'm not saying relapse is inevitable. I'm not saying you should plan to relapse. I'm saying if it happens, it doesn't mean you're a failure.

It means you're human.

Here's what to do if you relapse:

**1. Don't spiral:** One use doesn't have to become a week-long bender. Stop as soon as you can. Get back on track immediately.

**2. Reach out:** Call your sponsor. Go to a meeting. Text your accountability partner. Don't isolate. Shame thrives in secrecy.

**3. Analyze it:** What happened? What was the trigger? What was the emotional state? What could you do differently next time?

**4. Adjust your plan:** Maybe you need more meetings. Maybe you need a new therapist. Maybe you need to remove a person or place from your life. Use the data to make changes.

**5. Forgive yourself:** This is the hardest part. But it's the most important. You're not a bad person. You're a person in recovery. And recovery is messy.

Here's what I know: the people who stay sober long-term aren't the people who never relapse. They're the people who get back up every time they fall.

They're the people who learn from their mistakes. They're the people who refuse to give up.

You're one of those people.

So if you've relapsed, I want you to hear this: you're not a failure. You're a fighter.

And you're going to make it.

### Video 7: Building Your Recovery Toolkit

**Duration:** 10-12 minutes  
**Tone:** Empowering, practical, celebratory  
**Delivery:** Energetic, motivating, action-oriented

---

**SCRIPT:**

We made it. Day 7.

You've spent the last six days learning about nervous system dysregulation, trauma, willpower, somatic tools, process addictions, and relapse.

Today, we're putting it all together. We're building your recovery toolkit.

Because here's the truth: recovery isn't one thing. It's a collection of tools, practices, and resources that you use every single day.

So let's build your toolkit.

**Tool #1: Daily Practices**  
These are non-negotiables. Things you do every day, no matter what.

- Breathwork (5-10 minutes)
- Meditation or prayer (5-10 minutes)
- Movement (walk, yoga, weights, etc.)
- Gratitude practice (write down 3 things)
- Check-in with yourself (how am I feeling? What do I need today?)

These practices regulate your nervous system. They build resilience. They keep you grounded.

**Tool #2: Support System**  
You cannot do this alone. You need people.

- Sponsor or mentor
- Therapist or counselor
- Accountability partner
- Recovery community (meetings, groups, etc.)
- Friends and family who support your sobriety

Isolation is the enemy of recovery. Connection is the antidote.

**Tool #3: Emergency Plan**  
What do you do when a craving hits? When you're triggered? When you're on the edge?

Write it down. Make it specific.

- Call my sponsor
- Go to a meeting (have a list of meeting times)
- Do 10 minutes of box breathing
- Take a cold shower
- Go for a walk
- Text my accountability partner
- Read recovery literature
- Watch a recovery video

You need a plan BEFORE the crisis. Not during.

**Tool #4: Boundaries**  
What people, places, or things do you need to remove from your life?

- Toxic relationships
- Triggering environments
- Access to substances or compulsive behaviors

Boundaries aren't mean. They're self-care.

**Tool #5: Purpose**  
What are you staying sober for? What's your why?

- Your kids
- Your health
- Your relationships
- Your career
- Your peace of mind
- Your future self

Write it down. Look at it every day.

**Tool #6: Self-Compassion**  
This is the hardest tool. But it's the most important.

You're going to mess up. You're going to have bad days. You're going to struggle.

And when that happens, you have to talk to yourself the way you'd talk to a friend.

Not with shame. Not with judgment. But with kindness.

"I'm doing the best I can. I'm learning. I'm growing. I'm not perfect, but I'm trying."

That's the voice that keeps you sober.

So here's your assignment: take the next hour and build your toolkit. Write it down. Make it real.

And then use it. Every single day.

You've got this.

I believe in you.

Let's keep going.

### Video 8 (Day 1): The Trauma-Addiction Connection

**Duration:** 12-15 minutes  
**Tone:** Educational, validating, foundational  
**Delivery:** Grounded, authoritative, compassionate

---

**SCRIPT:**

Welcome to From Broken to Whole. Over the next 30 days, we're going deep. We're going to unpack the trauma-addiction connection, heal your nervous system, process shame, rebuild relationships, and discover purpose.

This isn't a quick fix. This is transformation.

Let's start with the foundation: the trauma-addiction connection.

Here's what most people get wrong about addiction: they think it's about the substance or the behavior.

It's not.

Addiction is about pain. And more specifically, it's about unprocessed trauma.

Dr. Gabor Maté says it best: "The question isn't why the addiction, but why the pain."

So let's talk about the pain.

Trauma is any experience that overwhelms your capacity to cope. It's not about the event itself—it's about how your nervous system responds to it.

For some people, that's overt abuse—physical, sexual, emotional. For others, it's neglect—being ignored, dismissed, or abandoned. For others, it's chaos—growing up in a home with addiction, violence, or instability.

And for many, it's more subtle. It's emotional unavailability. It's conditional love. It's feeling like you were never enough.

All of these experiences shape your nervous system. They teach you that the world is unsafe. That people can't be trusted. That you have to protect yourself.

And here's where addiction comes in.

When you use a substance or engage in a compulsive behavior, you're not just chasing pleasure. You're self-medicating pain.

You're trying to numb the anxiety. Quiet the shame. Escape the emptiness. Feel alive when you've been numb for years.

Addiction is a solution. It's not a good solution, but it's a solution.

And until you address the pain underneath, you'll keep going back to it.

This is why abstinence alone doesn't work. You can white-knuckle your way through sobriety, but if you don't heal the trauma, you're just dry—not sober.

So what does healing look like?

It starts with understanding. Understanding that your addiction isn't a moral failing. It's a survival strategy.

It continues with processing. Processing the trauma. Feeling the feelings you've been running from. Grieving what you lost.

And it ends with integration. Integrating the pain into your story. Not as something that defines you, but as something that shaped you.

You're not broken. You're wounded.

And wounds can heal.

Over the next 30 days, we're going to do that healing together.

Let's begin.

### Video 9 (Day 2): Attachment Wounds and How They Show Up

**Duration:** 12-15 minutes  
**Tone:** Compassionate, insightful, relational  
**Delivery:** Gentle, reflective, understanding

---

**SCRIPT:**

Today we're talking about attachment.

Attachment is the bond you form with your primary caregivers as a child. It's how you learn to relate to others. It's how you learn to trust. It's how you learn to regulate your emotions.

And if that bond is disrupted—if your caregivers are inconsistent, unavailable, or abusive—you develop an insecure attachment style.

And that insecure attachment shows up in your adult relationships. And in your addiction.

There are three main insecure attachment styles:

**Anxious Attachment:**  
You crave closeness, but you're terrified of abandonment. You're clingy. You're needy. You're constantly seeking reassurance.

In addiction, this shows up as using to cope with relationship anxiety. You drink when your partner pulls away. You use porn when you feel rejected. You engage in affairs to feel wanted.

**Avoidant Attachment:**  
You value independence above all else. You keep people at arm's length. You don't trust anyone to meet your needs, so you don't ask.

In addiction, this shows up as using to avoid intimacy. You drink to numb the loneliness. You work obsessively to avoid connection. You use substances to keep people from getting too close.

**Disorganized Attachment:**  
You want closeness, but you're terrified of it. You push people away, then pull them back. You're chaotic in relationships.

In addiction, this shows up as using to manage the chaos. You drink to calm the anxiety of intimacy. You engage in compulsive behaviors to feel in control when relationships feel out of control.

Here's the thing: these attachment styles aren't your fault. They're adaptations. They're how you learned to survive in an environment that wasn't safe.

But they're also keeping you stuck.

Because insecure attachment makes it hard to build the relationships you need for recovery. It makes it hard to trust your sponsor. It makes it hard to be vulnerable in therapy. It makes it hard to let people in.

So how do you heal attachment wounds?

**1. Awareness:** Recognize your attachment style. Notice how it shows up in your relationships.

**2. Therapy:** Work with a therapist who understands attachment. This is deep work. You can't do it alone.

**3. Corrective experiences:** Build relationships with people who are consistent, safe, and trustworthy. Let them show you that not everyone will abandon you. Not everyone will hurt you.

**4. Self-compassion:** Be patient with yourself. These patterns have been with you for decades. They're not going to change overnight.

Attachment wounds are some of the deepest wounds we carry.

But they can heal.

And when they do, everything changes.

### Video 10 (Day 3): The Four Nervous System States

**Duration:** 12-15 minutes  
**Tone:** Educational, practical, empowering  
**Delivery:** Clear, instructional, accessible

---

**SCRIPT:**

Let's talk about the four nervous system states. This is foundational to understanding how trauma shows up in your body.

Your nervous system has two main branches: the sympathetic nervous system (fight or flight) and the parasympathetic nervous system (rest and digest).

But it's more nuanced than that. There are actually four states:

**1. Ventral Vagal (Safe and Social):**  
This is your optimal state. You feel calm, connected, and engaged. Your heart rate is steady. Your breathing is easy. You can think clearly and relate to others.

This is where you want to be most of the time.

**2. Sympathetic (Fight or Flight):**  
This is your stress response. Your heart rate increases. Your breathing gets shallow. Your muscles tense. You're ready to fight or run.

This is helpful in actual danger. But if you're stuck here chronically, it shows up as anxiety, hypervigilance, irritability, and insomnia.

**3. Dorsal Vagal (Freeze):**  
This is your shutdown response. When fight or flight doesn't work, your body freezes. You dissociate. You numb out. You feel disconnected from your body.

This shows up as depression, fatigue, brain fog, and emotional numbness.

**4. Fawn (People-Pleasing):**  
This is a trauma response where you appease others to stay safe. You abandon your own needs to meet theirs. You become a chameleon, shapeshifting to avoid conflict.

This shows up as codependency, lack of boundaries, and losing yourself in relationships.

Here's the key: addiction is a way to move between these states.

If you're stuck in sympathetic (anxious, hypervigilant), you drink to calm down. You use substances to drop into dorsal vagal (numb, shut down).

If you're stuck in dorsal vagal (depressed, disconnected), you use stimulants or engage in compulsive behaviors to jump into sympathetic (feel alive, feel something).

You're not using because you're weak. You're using because your nervous system is dysregulated.

So how do you regulate?

**1. Recognize your state:** Throughout the day, check in. Where am I right now? Ventral vagal? Sympathetic? Dorsal vagal? Fawn?

**2. Use tools to shift:** If you're in sympathetic, use calming tools (breathwork, grounding). If you're in dorsal vagal, use activating tools (movement, cold exposure).

**3. Build ventral vagal capacity:** Spend time with safe people. Engage in activities that bring you joy. Practice gratitude. These all strengthen your ability to stay in the safe and social state.

Your nervous system is trainable.

You just have to train it.

### Video 11 (Day 4): Fight, Flight, Freeze, Fawn

**Duration:** 12-15 minutes  
**Tone:** Validating, educational, practical  
**Delivery:** Normalizing, empowering, clear

---

**SCRIPT:**

We touched on the four trauma responses yesterday. Today, we're going deeper.

Because understanding your dominant trauma response is key to understanding your addiction.

**Fight:**  
When you're in fight mode, you respond to threat with anger, aggression, or control.

You pick fights. You lash out. You dominate. You micromanage.

In addiction, this shows up as using to manage rage. You drink to calm the anger. You use substances to avoid exploding.

**Flight:**  
When you're in flight mode, you respond to threat by escaping.

You stay busy. You work obsessively. You avoid. You run.

In addiction, this shows up as using to escape. You drink to avoid feelings. You use porn to avoid intimacy. You work to avoid being present.

**Freeze:**  
When you're in freeze mode, you shut down. You dissociate. You numb out.

You feel paralyzed. You can't make decisions. You feel disconnected from your body.

In addiction, this shows up as using to feel something. You use stimulants to wake up. You engage in risky behaviors to feel alive.

**Fawn:**  
When you're in fawn mode, you people-please. You abandon your needs to meet others'.

You say yes when you mean no. You lose yourself in relationships. You become a chameleon.

In addiction, this shows up as using to cope with codependency. You drink to tolerate relationships that hurt you. You use substances to numb the resentment of always putting others first.

Here's the thing: most people have a dominant response. But you can cycle through all four.

And here's why this matters: you can't heal what you don't understand.

If you don't know that your anger is a fight response, you'll just think you're a bad person.

If you don't know that your people-pleasing is a fawn response, you'll just think you're weak.

But once you understand that these are trauma responses—adaptations you developed to survive—you can start to heal them.

So here's your assignment:

Identify your dominant trauma response. Notice when it shows up. And start to ask: what am I protecting myself from?

That's where the healing begins.

**Tone:** Compassionate, educational, validating  
**Delivery:** Gentle, understanding, hopeful

---

**SCRIPT:**

Let's talk about how childhood trauma shaped your nervous system.

Your nervous system develops in the first few years of life. And it develops in relationship with your caregivers.

If your caregivers are safe, consistent, and attuned, your nervous system learns that the world is safe. You develop secure attachment. You learn to regulate your emotions. You learn to trust.

But if your caregivers are inconsistent, unavailable, or abusive, your nervous system learns that the world is dangerous. You develop insecure attachment. You learn to self-soothe in unhealthy ways. You learn to protect yourself.

And here's the key: this isn't conscious. This is happening at a neurological level.

Your brain is wiring itself based on your environment.

So if you grow up in chaos, your brain wires for hypervigilance. You're always scanning for danger. You can't relax, even when you're safe.

If you grow up with neglect, your brain wires for shutdown. You learn to dissociate. You learn to numb out.

If you grow up with abuse, your brain wires for survival. Fight, flight, freeze, fawn.

And here's the problem: these patterns don't just go away when you become an adult.

They stay with you. They show up in your relationships. They show up in your work. They show up in your addiction.

You're not broken. You're adapted.

But here's the good news: your brain is neuroplastic. It can change.

You can rewire your nervous system. You can build new neural pathways. You can heal.

But it takes time. And it takes intention.

Here's how:

**1. Therapy:** Especially trauma-focused therapy like EMDR, somatic experiencing, or internal family systems.

**2. Somatic practices:** Breathwork, yoga, movement, grounding. These help you release trauma from your body.

**3. Safe relationships:** Surround yourself with people who are consistent, trustworthy, and attuned. Let them show you what safety feels like.

**4. Self-compassion:** Be patient with yourself. Your nervous system has been wired this way for decades. It's going to take time to rewire it.

You didn't choose the trauma. But you can choose the healing.

Let's do this together.

### Video 13 (Day 6): The Role of Shame in Addiction

**Duration:** 12-15 minutes  
**Tone:** Compassionate, validating, transformative  
**Delivery:** Warm, gentle, liberating

---

**SCRIPT:**

Let's talk about shame.

Shame is the belief that you are fundamentally flawed. That you are bad. That you are unworthy of love.

And shame is the fuel of addiction.

Here's how it works:

You experience trauma. You internalize the message that you're not enough. You carry shame.

You use substances or compulsive behaviors to numb the shame. Temporarily, it works.

But then you feel shame about using. "I'm weak. I'm a failure. I can't even stay sober."

So you use again to numb the shame about using.

This is the shame-addiction cycle. And it's vicious.

Brené Brown says, "Shame thrives in secrecy, silence, and judgment."

And that's exactly how addiction operates. You hide. You isolate. You judge yourself.

And the more you hide, the more shame you feel. And the more shame you feel, the more you use.

So how do you break the cycle?

**1. Bring it into the light:** Shame loses its power when you speak it out loud. Tell your sponsor. Tell your therapist. Tell your accountability partner.

**2. Separate shame from guilt:** Guilt says, "I did something bad." Shame says, "I am bad." Guilt is helpful—it motivates change. Shame is toxic—it keeps you stuck.

**3. Practice self-compassion:** Talk to yourself the way you'd talk to a friend. Not with judgment, but with kindness.

**4. Build shame resilience:** Surround yourself with people who see you, accept you, and love you—even when you mess up.

Here's what I want you to know: you are not your addiction. You are not your mistakes. You are not your shame.

You are a human being who is worthy of love, belonging, and healing.

And the more you believe that, the less power shame has over you.

Let's heal this together.

### Video 14 (Day 7): Grieving What You Lost

**Duration:** 12-15 minutes  
**Tone:** Compassionate, cathartic, hopeful  
**Delivery:** Tender, reflective, healing

---

**SCRIPT:**

Let's talk about grief.

When you get sober, you don't just lose the substance or the behavior. You lose a lot more.

You lose the version of yourself who used. You lose the relationships that were built around using. You lose the coping mechanism that got you through the hardest moments of your life.

And you have to grieve that.

Most people skip this step. They think, "I should just be grateful I'm sober. Why am I sad?"

Because grief is a natural part of loss. And sobriety is loss.

Here's what you might be grieving:

- The time you lost to addiction
- The relationships you damaged or destroyed
- The opportunities you missed
- The version of yourself you could have been
- The childhood you never had
- The safety you never felt

This grief is real. And it's valid.

And if you don't process it, it will keep you stuck.

So how do you grieve?

**1. Feel it:** Don't numb it. Don't avoid it. Sit with the sadness. Cry. Journal. Let it move through you.

**2. Talk about it:** Share it with your therapist, your sponsor, your support group. Grief needs witnesses.

**3. Ritualize it:** Write a letter to your past self. Create a ceremony to honor what you lost. Plant a tree. Light a candle.

**4. Give yourself time:** Grief doesn't have a timeline. Be patient with yourself.

And here's the beautiful part: on the other side of grief is acceptance.

Acceptance that you can't change the past. Acceptance that you did the best you could with what you had. Acceptance that you're here now, doing the work.

And from acceptance comes peace.

You're not just getting sober. You're becoming whole.

And that requires grieving what was, so you can step into what will be.

Let's keep going.

### Video 15 (Day 8): Why You Turned to Compulsive Behaviors

**Duration:** 12-15 minutes  
**Tone:** Validating, educational, compassionate  
**Delivery:** Understanding, normalizing, empowering

---

**SCRIPT:**

Let's talk about why you turned to compulsive behaviors in the first place.

Because here's the truth: you didn't wake up one day and decide to become addicted. You were trying to solve a problem.

The problem was pain. Emotional pain. Psychological pain. The pain of trauma.

And compulsive behaviors—whether substances or process addictions—offered relief.

They worked. At least temporarily.

Let me explain.

When you're in pain—when you're anxious, depressed, lonely, ashamed—your brain is looking for a way out. It's looking for relief.

And when you find something that works—alcohol, porn, work, food, shopping—your brain remembers it.

It creates a neural pathway. A shortcut. "When I feel bad, I do this, and I feel better."

This is how addiction starts. Not with moral failure. Not with weakness. But with your brain trying to survive.

And here's the thing: the more you use that pathway, the stronger it gets. It becomes automatic. It becomes compulsive.

You're not choosing to use anymore. Your brain is defaulting to it.

This is why addiction is so hard to break. You're not just fighting a habit. You're fighting a deeply ingrained neural pathway.

But here's the good news: you can build new pathways.

You can teach your brain new ways to cope. New ways to regulate. New ways to find relief.

It takes time. It takes repetition. It takes intention.

But it's possible.

Here's how:

**1. Identify the pain:** What are you trying to escape? Anxiety? Shame? Loneliness? Boredom? Name it.

**2. Find healthier alternatives:** What else can you do when you feel that pain? Breathwork? Movement? Connection? Creativity?

**3. Practice the new pathway:** Every time you choose the healthier alternative, you're strengthening that neural pathway. And weakening the old one.

**4. Be patient:** It's going to feel awkward at first. It's going to feel like it doesn't work. But keep going. Your brain is rewiring.

You didn't turn to compulsive behaviors because you're weak.

You turned to them because you're human. And you were trying to survive.

Now, you're learning a better way.

### Video 16 (Day 9): Nervous System States and Addiction Triggers

**Duration:** 12-15 minutes  
**Tone:** Educational, practical, empowering  
**Delivery:** Clear, instructional, actionable

---

**SCRIPT:**

Today we're talking about how your nervous system states trigger addiction.

Because here's what most people don't understand: cravings aren't random. They're tied to your nervous system state.

Let me break this down.

When you're in **sympathetic activation** (fight or flight), you feel anxious, agitated, hypervigilant. Your heart is racing. Your mind is spinning.

And what do you reach for? Something to calm you down. Alcohol. Benzos. Weed. Porn. Anything that brings you back to baseline.

When you're in **dorsal vagal shutdown** (freeze), you feel numb, disconnected, depressed. You're dissociated from your body.

And what do you reach for? Something to wake you up. Stimulants. Caffeine. Risky behaviors. Anything that makes you feel alive.

When you're in **fawn mode** (people-pleasing), you're exhausted from putting everyone else first. You're resentful. You're depleted.

And what do you reach for? Something to escape. Shopping. Eating. Scrolling. Anything that gives you a break from the demands.

See the pattern?

Addiction is your nervous system trying to regulate itself.

So if you want to stop the addiction, you have to learn to regulate your nervous system in healthier ways.

Here's how:

**For Sympathetic Activation (Anxiety):**
- Box breathing (4-4-4-4)
- Progressive muscle relaxation
- Grounding techniques (5-4-3-2-1)
- Cold water on face
- Gentle movement (walk, stretch)

**For Dorsal Vagal Shutdown (Numbness):**
- Vigorous movement (run, dance, jump)
- Cold shower or ice bath
- Loud music
- Bilateral stimulation (tapping, walking)
- Connection with safe people

**For Fawn Mode (People-Pleasing):**
- Set a boundary
- Say no to something
- Do something just for you
- Journal about resentment
- Practice self-compassion

The key is to recognize your state BEFORE you reach for the compulsive behavior.

Ask yourself: "What state am I in right now? What does my nervous system need?"

And then give it what it needs. In a healthy way.

This is how you break the cycle.

### Video 17 (Day 10): The Polyvagal Theory Explained

**Duration:** 12-15 minutes  
**Tone:** Educational, accessible, empowering  
**Delivery:** Clear, engaging, relatable

---

**SCRIPT:**

Let's talk about Polyvagal Theory. This is the science behind everything we've been discussing.

Polyvagal Theory was developed by Dr. Stephen Porges. And it explains how your nervous system responds to safety and threat.

Here's the basic idea:

Your vagus nerve is the main nerve of your parasympathetic nervous system. It has two branches:

**1. Ventral Vagal (Safe and Social):**  
This is your "rest and digest" state. You feel calm, connected, and engaged. This is your optimal state.

**2. Dorsal Vagal (Shutdown):**  
This is your "freeze" state. When you can't fight or flee, you shut down. You dissociate. You numb out.

And then there's the sympathetic nervous system:

**3. Sympathetic (Fight or Flight):**  
This is your stress response. You're ready to fight or run.

Here's the key: your nervous system moves through these states in a specific order.

When you feel safe, you're in ventral vagal. You're calm, connected, engaged.

When you perceive a threat, you move into sympathetic. You're ready to fight or flee.

If fight or flight doesn't work, you move into dorsal vagal. You freeze. You shut down.

This is called the **autonomic ladder**.

And here's where addiction comes in:

If you're stuck on the sympathetic rung (anxious, hypervigilant), you use substances to climb down to ventral vagal (calm).

If you're stuck on the dorsal vagal rung (numb, shut down), you use substances to climb up to sympathetic (feel something).

You're not using because you're weak. You're using because your nervous system is stuck.

So how do you get unstuck?

**1. Build safety:** Your nervous system needs to feel safe before it can heal. This means safe relationships, safe environments, safe routines.

**2. Practice co-regulation:** Spend time with people who are calm and grounded. Their nervous system will help regulate yours.

**3. Use somatic tools:** Breathwork, movement, grounding. These help you move between states intentionally.

**4. Be patient:** Your nervous system has been stuck for years, maybe decades. It's going to take time to unstuck it.

Polyvagal Theory isn't just science. It's a roadmap for healing.

And now you have the map.

### Video 18 (Day 11): How Dysregulation Drives Cravings

**Duration:** 12-15 minutes  
**Tone:** Practical, validating, solution-focused  
**Delivery:** Direct, clear, empowering

---

**SCRIPT:**

Let's talk about how dysregulation drives cravings.

Because here's the truth: most cravings aren't about the substance or the behavior. They're about your nervous system state.

When your nervous system is dysregulated—when you're anxious, numb, overwhelmed, or shut down—your brain is looking for a way to regulate.

And if you've trained your brain that alcohol, porn, work, or food is the way to regulate, that's what it's going to crave.

This is why cravings feel so urgent. So overwhelming. So impossible to resist.

Because your brain thinks it needs that substance or behavior to survive.

But here's the good news: you can retrain your brain.

You can teach it new ways to regulate. And when you do, the cravings lose their power.

Here's how:

**Step 1: Recognize the dysregulation**  
When a craving hits, pause. Ask yourself: "What state am I in right now?"

- Am I anxious? (Sympathetic)
- Am I numb? (Dorsal vagal)
- Am I people-pleasing? (Fawn)
- Am I angry? (Fight)
- Am I avoiding? (Flight)

Name the state.

**Step 2: Meet the need**  
Once you know your state, give your nervous system what it actually needs.

- If you're anxious → breathwork, grounding, cold water
- If you're numb → movement, music, connection
- If you're people-pleasing → set a boundary, do something for yourself
- If you're angry → vigorous movement, journaling, punching a pillow
- If you're avoiding → face the thing you're avoiding, or give yourself permission to rest

**Step 3: Ride the wave**  
Cravings are like waves. They build, they peak, and they pass.

If you can ride the wave for 10-15 minutes without acting on it, it will pass.

Use your tools. Breathe. Ground. Move. Connect.

The craving will pass.

**Step 4: Reflect**  
After the craving passes, reflect. What triggered it? What state were you in? What tool worked?

This is how you build self-awareness. This is how you get better at this.

Dysregulation drives cravings.

But regulation drives recovery.

### Video 19 (Day 12): Understanding Your Window of Tolerance

**Duration:** 12-15 minutes  
**Tone:** Educational, practical, empowering  
**Delivery:** Clear, accessible, actionable

---

**SCRIPT:**

Let's talk about your window of tolerance.

This is a concept from trauma therapy, and it's incredibly helpful for understanding why you use.

Your window of tolerance is the range of emotional and physiological arousal where you can function optimally.

When you're inside your window, you feel calm, grounded, and capable. You can think clearly. You can regulate your emotions. You can handle stress.

But when you're outside your window, you're dysregulated.

There are two ways to go outside your window:

**1. Hyperarousal (Above the window):**  
You're anxious, panicked, overwhelmed. Your heart is racing. Your mind is spinning. You can't calm down.

**2. Hypoarousal (Below the window):**  
You're numb, shut down, disconnected. You feel nothing. You're dissociated from your body.

And here's where addiction comes in:

When you're outside your window, your brain is looking for a way back in.

If you're in hyperarousal, you use substances to calm down. To drop back into your window.

If you're in hypoarousal, you use substances to wake up. To climb back into your window.

You're not using because you're weak. You're using because you're outside your window.

So how do you stay inside your window?

**1. Know your window:** What does it feel like when you're inside your window? What does it feel like when you're outside?

**2. Widen your window:** The more you practice regulation, the wider your window gets. You can handle more stress without dysregulating.

**3. Use tools to get back in:** When you notice you're outside your window, use your tools. Breathwork. Grounding. Movement. Connection.

**4. Prevent dysregulation:** Build a life that supports regulation. Routine. Sleep. Nutrition. Exercise. Safe relationships.

Your window of tolerance is like a muscle. The more you work it, the stronger it gets.

And the wider your window, the less you need addiction.

### Video 20 (Day 13): Co-Regulation vs. Self-Regulation

**Duration:** 12-15 minutes  
**Tone:** Relational, educational, empowering  
**Delivery:** Warm, connecting, practical

---

**SCRIPT:**

Let's talk about co-regulation and self-regulation.

Because here's the truth: you can't regulate yourself in isolation.

Humans are social creatures. We're wired for connection. And we regulate our nervous systems through connection with others.

This is called **co-regulation**.

Co-regulation is when your nervous system syncs with another person's nervous system.

Think about it: when you're anxious and you talk to a calm friend, you start to feel calmer. When you're numb and you spend time with someone who's warm and engaged, you start to feel more alive.

That's co-regulation.

And it's essential for recovery.

Because here's the thing: if you grew up with trauma, you probably didn't learn how to self-regulate. Your caregivers didn't co-regulate with you. They didn't teach you how to calm down, how to process emotions, how to feel safe.

So you turned to substances or compulsive behaviors to regulate yourself.

But substances can't co-regulate with you. They can't attune to you. They can't help you build the capacity to self-regulate.

Only people can do that.

So here's what you need:

**1. Safe relationships:** Find people who are calm, grounded, and attuned. Spend time with them. Let their nervous system regulate yours.

**2. Therapy:** A good therapist is a co-regulator. They help you process emotions in a safe, attuned relationship.

**3. Recovery community:** Meetings, groups, support networks. These are co-regulating environments.

**4. Practice self-regulation:** As you experience more co-regulation, you'll start to internalize it. You'll build the capacity to self-regulate.

Here's the key: you can't skip co-regulation and go straight to self-regulation.

You have to experience regulation with others before you can regulate yourself.

This is why isolation is so dangerous in recovery. And why connection is so healing.

You're not meant to do this alone.

Find your people. Let them help you regulate.

And over time, you'll learn to regulate yourself.

### Video 21 (Day 14): Building Nervous System Resilience

**Duration:** 12-15 minutes  
**Tone:** Empowering, practical, motivating  
**Delivery:** Energetic, actionable, hopeful

---

**SCRIPT:**

We've spent two weeks talking about nervous system dysregulation. Today, we're talking about how to build nervous system resilience.

Because here's the goal: you don't just want to regulate your nervous system in the moment. You want to build long-term resilience.

You want to widen your window of tolerance. You want to strengthen your capacity to handle stress. You want to build a nervous system that can bounce back.

Here's how:

**1. Daily practices:**  
Consistency is key. You have to practice regulation every single day.

- Breathwork (5-10 minutes)
- Meditation (5-10 minutes)
- Movement (20-30 minutes)
- Gratitude (write down 3 things)

These practices build resilience over time.

**2. Sleep:**  
Sleep is when your nervous system repairs itself. If you're not sleeping, you're not healing.

Aim for 7-9 hours. Keep a consistent sleep schedule. Create a bedtime routine.

**3. Nutrition:**  
Your nervous system needs fuel. Eat whole foods. Stay hydrated. Limit caffeine and sugar.

**4. Movement:**  
Exercise is one of the best ways to build nervous system resilience. It releases trauma from the body. It regulates your mood. It strengthens your stress response.

**5. Connection:**  
Safe relationships are essential. Spend time with people who are calm, grounded, and supportive.

**6. Boundaries:**  
Protect your nervous system. Say no to things that dysregulate you. Remove toxic people and environments from your life.

**7. Play:**  
Yes, play. Laughter. Joy. Fun. These activate your ventral vagal system. They build resilience.

**8. Nature:**  
Spend time outside. Nature is inherently regulating. It calms your nervous system.

**9. Therapy:**  
Work with a trauma-informed therapist. Process the trauma. Heal the wounds.

**10. Patience:**  
Building resilience takes time. Be patient with yourself. Celebrate small wins.

Your nervous system is like a muscle. The more you work it, the stronger it gets.

And the stronger it gets, the less you need addiction.

You're building a life where you don't need substances or compulsive behaviors to feel okay.

You're building a life where you feel okay just being you.

That's resilience.

Let's keep building.

### Video 22 (Day 15): Somatic Experiencing and Trauma Release

**Duration:** 12-15 minutes  
**Tone:** Educational, practical, empowering  
**Delivery:** Grounded, instructional, hopeful

---

**SCRIPT:**

Today we're talking about Somatic Experiencing—a powerful trauma therapy developed by Dr. Peter Levine.

Here's the basic idea: trauma gets stored in your body. Not just in your mind.

And talk therapy alone can't release it. You have to work with the body.

Somatic Experiencing teaches you to tune into your body's sensations. To notice where you're holding tension, pain, or numbness.

And then to gently release it.

Here's how it works:

**Step 1: Notice sensations**  
Close your eyes. Scan your body. Where do you feel tension? Tightness? Numbness? Heat? Cold?

Don't judge it. Just notice it.

**Step 2: Stay with it**  
Instead of avoiding the sensation, stay with it. Breathe into it.

This is called "pendulation"—moving between comfort and discomfort.

**Step 3: Let it move**  
Trauma wants to move through your body. It wants to be released.

You might feel the urge to shake, cry, yawn, or stretch. Let it happen.

**Step 4: Complete the response**  
In trauma, your body's natural response (fight, flight, freeze) gets interrupted. Somatic Experiencing helps you complete that response.

For example, if you froze during trauma, you might need to physically push something away. Or run. Or shake.

This completes the cycle. And releases the trauma.

Here's a simple practice you can try:

**Trauma Release Exercise:**

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart.
2. Shake your hands vigorously for 30 seconds.
3. Shake your arms. Your legs. Your whole body.
4. Let yourself make sounds if you want to.
5. After 1-2 minutes, stop. Stand still. Notice how you feel.

This simple practice can release stored trauma.

You can also work with a Somatic Experiencing practitioner. They'll guide you through more advanced techniques.

The key is this: trauma lives in your body. And healing has to include your body.

You can't think your way out of trauma. You have to feel your way through it.

And Somatic Experiencing gives you the tools to do that safely.

### Video 23 (Day 16): EMDR and Processing Traumatic Memories

**Duration:** 12-15 minutes  
**Tone:** Educational, hopeful, empowering  
**Delivery:** Clear, reassuring, informative

---

**SCRIPT:**

Today we're talking about EMDR—Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing.

EMDR is one of the most effective trauma therapies out there. And it's been a game-changer for a lot of people in recovery.

Here's how it works:

When you experience trauma, your brain doesn't process it properly. The memory gets stuck. It stays "live" in your nervous system.

And every time you're reminded of the trauma, your body reacts as if it's happening again.

EMDR helps your brain reprocess the memory. It helps you integrate it. So it becomes a memory of the past, not a threat in the present.

Here's the process:

**Step 1: Identify the memory**  
You work with an EMDR therapist to identify a traumatic memory you want to process.

**Step 2: Bilateral stimulation**  
While you think about the memory, the therapist guides you through bilateral stimulation. This could be:
- Following their finger with your eyes (left to right)
- Tapping alternately on your knees
- Listening to tones that alternate between your left and right ears

**Step 3: Process the memory**  
As you do the bilateral stimulation, your brain starts to reprocess the memory. You might have new insights. New emotions. New perspectives.

**Step 4: Install a positive belief**  
Once the memory is processed, you install a positive belief to replace the negative one.

For example:
- Old belief: "I'm not safe."
- New belief: "I'm safe now."

**Step 5: Body scan**  
You scan your body to make sure the trauma is fully processed. If there's still tension, you do more bilateral stimulation.

EMDR sounds simple. But it's incredibly powerful.

It helps your brain do what it's supposed to do: process trauma and move on.

Here's what you need to know:

**1. You need a trained therapist:** EMDR should be done with a certified EMDR therapist. Don't try to do it on your own.

**2. It can be intense:** Processing trauma is hard. You might feel worse before you feel better. But it's worth it.

**3. It works:** Study after study shows that EMDR is effective for PTSD, addiction, anxiety, and depression.

If you've tried talk therapy and it hasn't worked, EMDR might be the missing piece.

It's not about talking through the trauma. It's about processing it at a neurological level.

And when you do, everything changes.

### Video 24 (Day 17): Inner Child Work: Meeting Your Younger Self

**Duration:** 12-15 minutes  
**Tone:** Compassionate, tender, healing  
**Delivery:** Gentle, warm, nurturing

---

**SCRIPT:**

Today we're talking about inner child work.

This is one of the most powerful—and most emotional—parts of trauma healing.

Here's the idea: the part of you that experienced trauma as a child is still inside you.

And that part is still hurting. Still scared. Still waiting for someone to see them, hear them, and protect them.

Inner child work is about going back to that younger version of yourself and giving them what they needed.

Here's how to do it:

**Step 1: Visualize your younger self**  
Close your eyes. Picture yourself as a child. How old are you? What are you wearing? Where are you?

Really see them.

**Step 2: Notice how they're feeling**  
What emotion is your inner child feeling? Scared? Sad? Angry? Lonely?

Don't judge it. Just notice it.

**Step 3: Approach them**  
Imagine yourself as you are now, approaching your younger self.

What do they need from you? A hug? Words of comfort? Protection?

**Step 4: Give them what they need**  
Tell them:
- "I see you."
- "I'm here now."
- "You're safe."
- "It's not your fault."
- "I'm going to take care of you."

Say whatever they need to hear.

**Step 5: Bring them with you**  
Imagine taking your inner child's hand and bringing them into the present with you.

They're not alone anymore. You're here.

This might sound cheesy. But I promise you, it's powerful.

Because here's the truth: your inner child is still running the show.

When you get triggered, it's your inner child who's scared.

When you feel shame, it's your inner child who feels unworthy.

When you use substances, it's your inner child who's trying to cope.

And until you heal that part of yourself, you'll keep repeating the same patterns.

Inner child work is about reparenting yourself. Giving yourself the love, safety, and validation you didn't get as a kid.

It's about becoming the parent you needed.

And when you do, everything changes.

### Video 25 (Day 18): Reparenting Yourself

**Duration:** 12-15 minutes  
**Tone:** Empowering, nurturing, practical  
**Delivery:** Warm, supportive, actionable

---

**SCRIPT:**

Yesterday we talked about meeting your inner child. Today, we're talking about reparenting yourself.

Because here's the truth: if you didn't get the parenting you needed as a child, you have to give it to yourself as an adult.

This isn't about blaming your parents. They did the best they could with what they had.

This is about taking responsibility for your own healing.

Here's what reparenting looks like:

**1. Set boundaries**  
A good parent protects their child. They say no to things that aren't safe.

You have to do the same for yourself.

Say no to toxic people. Say no to environments that trigger you. Say no to behaviors that hurt you.

**2. Provide structure**  
A good parent creates routine and consistency. It helps a child feel safe.

You have to do the same for yourself.

Wake up at the same time. Eat regular meals. Go to bed at the same time. Create rituals.

Structure creates safety.

**3. Meet your needs**  
A good parent makes sure their child's needs are met. Food. Sleep. Safety. Connection.

You have to do the same for yourself.

Don't skip meals. Don't sacrifice sleep. Don't isolate. Take care of your body.

**4. Validate your emotions**  
A good parent says, "I see you. Your feelings matter."

You have to do the same for yourself.

When you're sad, don't dismiss it. When you're angry, don't shame it. When you're scared, don't minimize it.

Say, "It makes sense that I feel this way."

**5. Celebrate your wins**  
A good parent celebrates their child's accomplishments. No matter how small.

You have to do the same for yourself.

Did you stay sober today? Celebrate it. Did you set a boundary? Celebrate it. Did you show up for yourself? Celebrate it.

**6. Offer comfort**  
A good parent comforts their child when they're hurting.

You have to do the same for yourself.

When you're struggling, don't beat yourself up. Comfort yourself. Talk to yourself the way you'd talk to a scared child.

"It's okay. You're going to be okay. I'm here."

Reparenting yourself is about becoming your own safe person.

It's about giving yourself the love, safety, and validation you've been searching for outside yourself.

And when you do, you don't need addiction anymore.

Because you have you.

### Video 26 (Day 19): Shame Processing Techniques

**Duration:** 12-15 minutes  
**Tone:** Compassionate, practical, liberating  
**Delivery:** Gentle, empowering, actionable

---

**SCRIPT:**

Let's talk about how to process shame.

Because shame doesn't just go away on its own. You have to actively work through it.

Here are the most effective shame processing techniques:

**1. Name it**  
Shame thrives in secrecy. So the first step is to name it.

Say it out loud: "I feel shame about _______."

Just naming it takes away some of its power.

**2. Share it**  
Shame loses its power when you bring it into the light.

Tell your sponsor. Tell your therapist. Tell your accountability partner.

And watch what happens. They won't reject you. They'll say, "Me too."

**3. Separate shame from guilt**  
Guilt says, "I did something bad."  
Shame says, "I am bad."

Guilt is about behavior. Shame is about identity.

When you feel shame, ask yourself: "Did I do something bad, or do I believe I am bad?"

If it's guilt, make amends. If it's shame, challenge the belief.

**4. Challenge the belief**  
Shame is built on lies. Lies like:
- "I'm not enough."
- "I'm unworthy of love."
- "I'm broken."

Write down the shame belief. Then challenge it.

Is it true? Is it absolutely true? What evidence do I have against it?

Replace it with a truth:
- "I am enough."
- "I am worthy of love."
- "I am healing."

**5. Practice self-compassion**  
Talk to yourself the way you'd talk to a friend.

Not: "I'm such a failure."  
But: "I'm doing the best I can. I'm learning. I'm growing."

**6. Write a shame letter**  
Write a letter to your shame. Tell it how it's affected you. Tell it you're done carrying it.

Then burn the letter. Literally. Let it go.

**7. Body work**  
Shame lives in your body. You can feel it in your chest, your stomach, your throat.

When you feel shame, breathe into it. Move it. Shake it out. Cry it out.

Let it move through you.

Shame is one of the hardest emotions to process. But it's also one of the most important.

Because on the other side of shame is freedom.

Freedom to be yourself. Freedom to make mistakes. Freedom to be human.

You are not your shame.

You are a human being who is worthy of love, belonging, and healing.

And the more you process the shame, the more you'll believe that.

### Video 27 (Day 20): Self-Forgiveness Practices

**Duration:** 12-15 minutes  
**Tone:** Compassionate, healing, hopeful  
**Delivery:** Tender, gentle, liberating

---

**SCRIPT:**

Let's talk about self-forgiveness.

This is one of the hardest parts of recovery. And one of the most necessary.

Because here's the truth: you can't move forward if you're still carrying the weight of your past.

You have to forgive yourself.

Not because what you did was okay. But because you're human. And humans make mistakes.

Here's how to practice self-forgiveness:

**1. Acknowledge what you did**  
Don't minimize it. Don't justify it. Don't avoid it.

Say it out loud: "I did _______. And it hurt people. Including myself."

Own it.

**2. Understand why you did it**  
You didn't do it because you're a bad person. You did it because you were in pain. You were dysregulated. You were trying to survive.

That doesn't excuse it. But it explains it.

**3. Feel the remorse**  
Let yourself feel the guilt. The regret. The sadness.

Don't numb it. Don't avoid it. Sit with it.

This is part of the healing.

**4. Make amends where possible**  
If you can make amends, do it. Apologize. Make it right.

But if you can't—if the person is gone, or if reaching out would cause more harm—make a living amends.

Change your behavior. Be the person you wish you'd been.

**5. Release the shame**  
Guilt says, "I did something bad."  
Shame says, "I am bad."

You did something bad. But you are not bad.

Release the shame. You are not your mistakes.

**6. Speak forgiveness out loud**  
Look in the mirror. Say your name. And say:

"I forgive you. You did the best you could with what you had. You were hurting. And you made mistakes. But you're not that person anymore. You're healing. You're growing. I forgive you."

Say it until you believe it.

**7. Write a forgiveness letter**  
Write a letter to yourself. From your future self. The version of you who's healed.

What would they say to you? What would they want you to know?

Write it. Read it. Keep it.

Self-forgiveness isn't a one-time event. It's a practice.

You're going to have to forgive yourself over and over again.

But every time you do, you get lighter.

You let go of a little more shame. A little more guilt. A little more pain.

And you make room for healing.

You deserve forgiveness.

Not because you're perfect. But because you're human.

And humans deserve grace.

### Video 28 (Day 21): Building Self-Compassion

**Duration:** 12-15 minutes  
**Tone:** Nurturing, empowering, transformative  
**Delivery:** Warm, gentle, encouraging

---

**SCRIPT:**

Let's talk about self-compassion.

This is the foundation of everything we've been building.

Because here's the truth: you can't heal if you're constantly beating yourself up.

You can't grow if you're constantly judging yourself.

You can't recover if you're constantly shaming yourself.

You need self-compassion.

Dr. Kristin Neff defines self-compassion as three things:

**1. Self-kindness (vs. self-judgment)**  
Treating yourself with the same kindness you'd treat a friend.

Not: "I'm such an idiot."  
But: "I made a mistake. I'm learning."

**2. Common humanity (vs. isolation)**  
Recognizing that suffering is part of being human. You're not alone in this.

Not: "I'm the only one who struggles."  
But: "Everyone struggles. This is part of being human."

**3. Mindfulness (vs. over-identification)**  
Observing your thoughts and feelings without getting swept away by them.

Not: "I am my anxiety."  
But: "I'm experiencing anxiety right now."

Here's how to practice self-compassion:

**1. Notice your self-talk**  
Throughout the day, pay attention to how you talk to yourself.

Are you kind? Or are you harsh?

**2. Reframe it**  
When you catch yourself being harsh, reframe it.

Harsh: "I'm such a failure."  
Compassionate: "I'm doing the best I can. I'm learning."

**3. Use a compassionate touch**  
When you're struggling, put your hand on your heart. Or give yourself a hug.

Physical touch activates your parasympathetic nervous system. It calms you down.

**4. Write yourself a compassionate letter**  
Write a letter to yourself from the perspective of a compassionate friend.

What would they say to you? What would they want you to know?

**5. Practice the self-compassion break**  
When you're struggling, say these three things:

- "This is a moment of suffering." (Mindfulness)
- "Suffering is part of life." (Common humanity)
- "May I be kind to myself." (Self-kindness)

**6. Celebrate small wins**  
Don't wait for big accomplishments to celebrate. Celebrate the small stuff.

You got out of bed today? That's a win.  
You didn't use today? That's a win.  
You showed up for yourself? That's a win.

Self-compassion isn't self-indulgence. It's not letting yourself off the hook.

It's treating yourself like a human being who deserves kindness.

And when you do, everything changes.

You stop running from yourself. You stop hating yourself. You stop hurting yourself.

And you start healing.

### Video 29 (Day 22): Healthy Relationships After Addiction

**Duration:** 12-15 minutes  
**Tone:** Practical, hopeful, relational  
**Delivery:** Warm, encouraging, actionable

---

**SCRIPT:**

Let's talk about building healthy relationships in recovery.

Because here's the truth: your relationships in addiction were probably unhealthy.

They were built on codependency, enabling, or trauma bonding.

And now that you're sober, you have to learn how to build healthy relationships.

Here's what that looks like:

**1. Mutual respect**  
In a healthy relationship, both people respect each other's boundaries, needs, and autonomy.

You don't try to control each other. You don't try to fix each other.

You respect each other.

**2. Honest communication**  
In a healthy relationship, you can say what you need. What you feel. What you want.

And the other person listens. They don't judge. They don't dismiss.

They hear you.

**3. Emotional safety**  
In a healthy relationship, you feel safe to be yourself.

You don't have to walk on eggshells. You don't have to hide parts of yourself.

You can be vulnerable. And you won't be punished for it.

**4. Interdependence (not codependence)**  
In a healthy relationship, you support each other. But you don't lose yourself.

You have your own interests. Your own friends. Your own identity.

You're two whole people choosing to be together. Not two halves trying to make a whole.

**5. Accountability**  
In a healthy relationship, you hold each other accountable.

If one person is slipping, the other says something. With love. With compassion. But they say something.

You don't enable each other.

Here's how to build healthy relationships:

**1. Start with yourself**  
You can't have a healthy relationship with someone else if you don't have a healthy relationship with yourself.

Work on your own healing first.

**2. Choose wisely**  
Not everyone is safe. Not everyone is healthy.

Choose people who are doing their own work. Who are self-aware. Who are committed to growth.

**3. Communicate your needs**  
Don't expect people to read your mind. Tell them what you need.

"I need space right now."  
"I need reassurance."  
"I need you to listen, not fix."

**4. Set boundaries**  
Boundaries aren't walls. They're guidelines.

They tell people how to treat you. And what you will and won't tolerate.

**5. Be willing to walk away**  
If a relationship is toxic, you have to be willing to walk away.

Your sobriety is more important than any relationship.

Healthy relationships are possible in recovery.

But they require work. Awareness. And a commitment to showing up as your healthiest self.

You deserve relationships that support your healing. Not relationships that keep you sick.

Choose wisely.

### Video 30 (Day 23): Setting Boundaries That Stick

**Duration:** 12-15 minutes  
**Tone:** Empowering, practical, firm  
**Delivery:** Direct, clear, confident

---

**SCRIPT:**

Let's talk about boundaries.

Because here's the truth: if you don't have boundaries, you won't stay sober.

Boundaries protect your recovery. They protect your peace. They protect your energy.

And they're non-negotiable.

Here's what boundaries are:

Boundaries are guidelines for how you want to be treated. And what you will and won't tolerate.

They're not about controlling other people. They're about taking responsibility for yourself.

Here are the most important boundaries in recovery:

**1. People boundaries**  
You have to remove toxic people from your life.

This might mean:
- Ending friendships with people who still use
- Distancing yourself from family members who enable you
- Leaving relationships that are unhealthy

It's hard. But it's necessary.

**2. Place boundaries**  
You have to avoid triggering environments.

This might mean:
- Not going to bars
- Not going to parties where people are using
- Not going to places that remind you of your addiction

**3. Time boundaries**  
You have to protect your time.

This might mean:
- Saying no to commitments that overwhelm you
- Scheduling time for self-care
- Prioritizing recovery activities (meetings, therapy, etc.)

**4. Emotional boundaries**  
You have to protect your emotional energy.

This might mean:
- Not taking on other people's problems
- Not letting other people's moods dictate yours
- Not feeling responsible for other people's feelings

Here's how to set boundaries:

**1. Get clear on what you need**  
What do you need to stay sober? What do you need to feel safe?

Write it down.

**2. Communicate it clearly**  
Tell people what your boundaries are.

"I can't be around alcohol right now."  
"I need you to not call me after 9pm."  
"I can't help you with that."

Be direct. Be clear.

**3. Enforce it**  
If someone crosses your boundary, enforce it.

This might mean:
- Leaving the situation
- Ending the conversation
- Ending the relationship

Boundaries without enforcement are just suggestions.

**4. Don't apologize**  
You don't have to apologize for having boundaries.

You don't have to explain them. You don't have to justify them.

"No" is a complete sentence.

**5. Expect pushback**  
People who benefited from your lack of boundaries will push back.

They'll call you selfish. They'll guilt you. They'll try to manipulate you.

Stand firm.

Your sobriety is more important than their comfort.

Boundaries aren't mean. They're self-care.

And they're essential for recovery.

### Video 31 (Day 24): Emotional Regulation Skills

**Duration:** 12-15 minutes  
**Tone:** Practical, empowering, instructional  
**Delivery:** Clear, actionable, supportive

---

**SCRIPT:**

Let's talk about emotional regulation.

Because here's the truth: if you don't learn how to regulate your emotions, you'll go back to using.

Addiction is a maladaptive coping mechanism. It's how you regulated your emotions when you didn't have healthier tools.

Now, you need healthier tools.

Here are the most effective emotional regulation skills:

**1. Name the emotion**  
You can't regulate an emotion you can't name.

When you're feeling something, pause. Ask yourself: "What am I feeling right now?"

Angry? Sad? Anxious? Ashamed? Lonely?

Name it.

**2. Validate the emotion**  
Don't judge it. Don't shame it. Don't dismiss it.

Say, "It makes sense that I feel this way."

Validation doesn't mean you have to act on the emotion. It just means you acknowledge it.

**3. Locate it in your body**  
Where do you feel the emotion in your body?

Anger might be in your chest. Anxiety might be in your stomach. Sadness might be in your throat.

Notice where it is.

**4. Breathe into it**  
Take slow, deep breaths. Breathe into the part of your body where you feel the emotion.

This calms your nervous system. And it helps the emotion move through you.

**5. Move it**  
Emotions are energy in motion. They want to move.

If you're angry, move vigorously. Punch a pillow. Go for a run.  
If you're sad, cry. Let it out.  
If you're anxious, shake. Dance. Stretch.

Let the emotion move through your body.

**6. Use opposite action**  
If the emotion is driving you toward an unhealthy behavior, do the opposite.

If you're anxious and want to isolate → reach out to someone.  
If you're angry and want to lash out → practice kindness.  
If you're sad and want to stay in bed → get up and move.

**7. Distract (temporarily)**  
Sometimes, you need a break from the emotion.

Watch a funny video. Call a friend. Go for a walk. Do a puzzle.

Distraction isn't avoidance. It's giving yourself a break so you can come back to the emotion later.

**8. Process it**  
Once you've regulated the intensity, process the emotion.

Journal about it. Talk to your therapist. Share it in a meeting.

Don't stuff it down. Process it.

Emotional regulation isn't about not feeling emotions. It's about feeling them without being overwhelmed by them.

It's about riding the wave instead of drowning in it.

And the more you practice, the better you get.

### Video 32 (Day 25): Building Community and Connection

**Duration:** 12-15 minutes  
**Tone:** Relational, warm, encouraging  
**Delivery:** Inviting, hopeful, connecting

---

**SCRIPT:**

Let's talk about community.

Because here's the truth: you cannot recover alone.

Isolation is the enemy of recovery. Connection is the antidote.

You need people. You need community.

Here's why:

**1. Accountability**  
When you're part of a community, you're accountable to others.

You show up. You check in. You tell the truth.

And that keeps you sober.

**2. Support**  
When you're struggling, you need people who get it.

People who've been there. People who understand.

Community provides that support.

**3. Belonging**  
Addiction is lonely. Recovery is about finding your people.

When you're part of a community, you belong. You're not alone anymore.

**4. Modeling**  
When you're part of a community, you see people who are further along in recovery.

They model what's possible. They give you hope.

**5. Purpose**  
When you're part of a community, you have a purpose.

You help others. You give back. You contribute.

And that gives your life meaning.

Here's how to build community:

**1. Go to meetings**  
AA. NA. SMART Recovery. Celebrate Recovery. Whatever resonates with you.

Show up. Consistently.

**2. Get a sponsor**  
Find someone who's been sober longer than you. Someone who's doing the work.

Ask them to sponsor you.

**3. Join a recovery group**  
Online or in-person. Find a group of people who are committed to recovery.

Show up. Share. Listen.

**4. Build sober friendships**  
Make friends who are sober. Who support your recovery.

Do sober activities together. Coffee. Walks. Movies. Workouts.

**5. Serve**  
Give back. Volunteer. Help newcomers.

Service gets you out of yourself. And it gives you purpose.

**6. Be vulnerable**  
Community requires vulnerability.

You have to be willing to share your struggles. Your fears. Your failures.

That's how you connect.

Here's the key: you have to show up.

Community doesn't just happen. You have to build it.

And it takes time. It takes effort. It takes vulnerability.

But it's worth it.

Because on the other side of isolation is connection.

And connection is where healing happens.

### Video 33 (Day 26): Finding Purpose in Recovery

**Duration:** 12-15 minutes  
**Tone:** Inspiring, reflective, hopeful  
**Delivery:** Thoughtful, motivating, visionary

---

**SCRIPT:**

Let's talk about purpose.

Because here's the truth: sobriety isn't enough.

You can be sober and miserable. You can be sober and lost. You can be sober and empty.

You need more than sobriety. You need purpose.

Purpose is what gets you out of bed in the morning. It's what gives your life meaning. It's what makes you want to stay sober.

Here's how to find it:

**1. Reflect on your values**  
What matters to you? What do you care about?

Family? Health? Creativity? Service? Justice? Connection?

Write down your top 5 values.

**2. Identify your strengths**  
What are you good at? What comes naturally to you?

Are you a good listener? A problem-solver? A creator? A helper?

Write down your strengths.

**3. Think about what you loved as a kid**  
Before life got hard. Before trauma. Before addiction.

What did you love to do? What brought you joy?

That's a clue to your purpose.

**4. Ask: What breaks your heart?**  
What injustice makes you angry? What suffering makes you sad?

That's another clue. Your purpose is often found in what breaks your heart.

**5. Experiment**  
Try new things. Volunteer. Take a class. Start a project.

You won't find your purpose by thinking about it. You'll find it by doing.

**6. Serve others**  
Purpose is often found in service.

How can you help others? How can you give back?

Maybe it's sponsoring newcomers. Maybe it's volunteering. Maybe it's starting a recovery blog.

Service gives your life meaning.

**7. Be patient**  
Finding your purpose takes time. It's not a one-time event. It's a journey.

Be patient with yourself.

Here's what I know: your addiction was trying to fill a void.

And that void is purpose.

You were searching for meaning. For connection. For something bigger than yourself.

And you tried to find it in substances or compulsive behaviors.

But it was never there.

Purpose is found in living a life aligned with your values. In using your strengths to serve others. In doing work that matters.

You don't have to have it all figured out today.

But start asking the questions. Start experimenting. Start serving.

Your purpose is waiting for you.

### Video 34 (Day 27): Discovering Meaning Beyond Sobriety

**Duration:** 12-15 minutes  
**Tone:** Reflective, inspiring, transformative  
**Delivery:** Thoughtful, deep, hopeful

---

**SCRIPT:**

Let's talk about meaning.

Because here's the truth: sobriety is the foundation. But it's not the destination.

The destination is a life of meaning.

Viktor Frankl, a Holocaust survivor and psychiatrist, wrote a book called "Man's Search for Meaning."

He said that the primary drive in human life isn't pleasure. It's meaning.

And when you have meaning, you can endure anything.

This is true in recovery.

If your only goal is to not use, you're going to struggle.

But if your goal is to build a life of meaning, sobriety becomes a natural byproduct.

So how do you discover meaning?

**1. Meaning through work**  
What work are you called to do? What contribution do you want to make?

It doesn't have to be a job. It could be raising your kids. Creating art. Volunteering.

What work gives your life meaning?

**2. Meaning through love**  
Who do you love? Who do you serve? Who do you show up for?

Meaning is found in relationships. In connection. In love.

**3. Meaning through suffering**  
This is the hardest one. But it's the most powerful.

Frankl said that even in suffering, you can find meaning.

You can choose how you respond to suffering. You can choose what it means.

Your addiction was suffering. But it doesn't have to be meaningless suffering.

You can use it to help others. You can use it to grow. You can use it to become who you're meant to be.

That's meaning.

**4. Meaning through growth**  
Are you becoming the person you want to be?

Are you growing? Learning? Evolving?

Growth gives life meaning.

**5. Meaning through legacy**  
What do you want to leave behind?

What impact do you want to have on the world?

Your legacy doesn't have to be grand. It could be the way you loved your family. The way you showed up for your community. The way you helped one person.

That's meaning.

Here's the key: meaning isn't something you find. It's something you create.

You create it through your choices. Your actions. Your relationships. Your values.

You create it by showing up. By doing the work. By living intentionally.

Sobriety gives you the opportunity to create a life of meaning.

Don't waste it.

### Video 35 (Day 28): Spiritual Awakening Practices

**Duration:** 12-15 minutes  
**Tone:** Reflective, open, inviting  
**Delivery:** Gentle, inclusive, inspiring

---

**SCRIPT:**

Let's talk about spirituality.

Now, I know that word can be loaded. Especially if you've had bad experiences with religion.

But spirituality isn't religion. It's connection.

Connection to something bigger than yourself. Connection to meaning. Connection to purpose.

And for a lot of people in recovery, spirituality is essential.

Here's why:

Addiction is disconnection. It's isolation. It's feeling separate from yourself, from others, from the world.

Spirituality is reconnection. It's belonging. It's feeling part of something bigger.

And that reconnection is healing.

Here are some spiritual practices that can support your recovery:

**1. Meditation**  
Meditation is about being present. About quieting the noise. About connecting to yourself.

Start with 5 minutes a day. Just sit. Breathe. Notice your thoughts without judging them.

**2. Prayer**  
Prayer doesn't have to be religious. It can be a conversation with the universe. With your higher self. With God. With whatever you believe in.

It's about asking for help. Expressing gratitude. Surrendering control.

**3. Gratitude**  
Gratitude is a spiritual practice. It shifts your focus from what's wrong to what's right.

Every day, write down 3 things you're grateful for.

**4. Nature**  
Spend time in nature. Walk in the woods. Sit by the ocean. Watch the sunset.

Nature connects you to something bigger. It reminds you you're part of a larger whole.

**5. Service**  
Service is a spiritual practice. It gets you out of yourself. It connects you to others.

Help someone. Give back. Contribute.

**6. Journaling**  
Write. Reflect. Process.

Journaling helps you connect to your inner wisdom. It helps you make sense of your experience.

**7. Community**  
Spirituality isn't just individual. It's communal.

Be part of a community. A recovery group. A faith community. A circle of friends.

Connection is spiritual.

**8. Surrender**  
This is the hardest one. But it's the most powerful.

Surrender control. Admit you don't have all the answers. Trust the process.

AA calls it "turning it over to a higher power."

You don't have to call it that. But you do have to let go.

Spirituality in recovery isn't about dogma. It's about connection.

Connection to yourself. To others. To something bigger.

And that connection is what keeps you sober.

### Video 36 (Day 29): Maintaining Recovery Long-Term

**Duration:** 12-15 minutes  
**Tone:** Practical, empowering, realistic  
**Delivery:** Grounded, honest, encouraging

---

**SCRIPT:**

Let's talk about maintaining recovery long-term.

Because here's the truth: getting sober is hard. Staying sober is harder.

The first 30 days, you're motivated. You're committed. You're doing the work.

But what about day 100? Day 365? Day 3,650?

How do you stay sober for the long haul?

Here's how:

**1. Make recovery your priority**  
Recovery can't be something you do when you have time. It has to be your priority.

That means:
- Meetings (even when you don't feel like it)
- Therapy (even when it's hard)
- Daily practices (even when you're busy)

Recovery first. Everything else second.

**2. Build a sustainable routine**  
You can't white-knuckle your way through life.

You need a routine that supports your recovery. A routine you can maintain long-term.

That might mean:
- Morning routine (meditation, breathwork, journaling)
- Evening routine (gratitude, reflection, wind-down)
- Weekly routine (meetings, therapy, connection)

Make it sustainable.

**3. Stay connected**  
Isolation is the enemy of recovery.

Even when you're doing well, stay connected.

Go to meetings. Call your sponsor. Spend time with sober friends.

Connection keeps you sober.

**4. Keep doing the work**  
Recovery isn't a destination. It's a journey.

You don't "arrive" and then stop working.

You keep going to therapy. You keep processing trauma. You keep growing.

The work never stops. But it gets easier.

**5. Watch for complacency**  
The most dangerous time in recovery is when you think you've got it figured out.

When you stop going to meetings. When you stop calling your sponsor. When you stop doing the work.

That's when relapse happens.

Stay humble. Stay vigilant.

**6. Have a relapse prevention plan**  
Know your triggers. Know your warning signs. Know what to do when you're struggling.

Write it down. Share it with your support system.

And use it when you need it.

**7. Celebrate milestones**  
30 days. 90 days. 6 months. 1 year. 5 years. 10 years.

Celebrate them. Acknowledge them. Be proud of them.

But don't rest on them. Keep going.

**8. Give back**  
Service keeps you sober.

Sponsor someone. Volunteer. Help newcomers.

Giving back reminds you where you came from. And why you never want to go back.

**9. Build a life you don't want to escape from**  
This is the key.

If your life is miserable, you're going to want to use.

So build a life you love. A life aligned with your values. A life of meaning and purpose.

That's what keeps you sober long-term.

**10. Be patient with yourself**  
Recovery isn't linear. You're going to have good days and bad days.

Be patient with yourself. Be kind to yourself.

You're doing the best you can.

Maintaining recovery long-term isn't about perfection. It's about consistency.

It's about showing up. Every single day.

Even when it's hard. Even when you don't feel like it.

You show up.

And that's how you stay sober.

**SCRIPT:**

We made it. Day 30.

You've spent the last 30 days learning about trauma, nervous system regulation, shame, attachment, somatic tools, boundaries, community, purpose, and meaning.

You've done the work. You've shown up. You've grown.

And now, you're standing at a new beginning.

Because here's the truth: this isn't the end. This is just the start.

The last 30 days were about building the foundation. Now, you get to build the life.

So what's next?

**1. Keep doing the work**  
Don't stop now. Keep going to therapy. Keep going to meetings. Keep practicing your tools.

The work never stops. But it gets easier.

**2. Build your life**  
Now that you have the foundation, start building.

What do you want your life to look like? What relationships do you want? What work do you want to do? What legacy do you want to leave?

Start building.

**3. Stay connected**  
You can't do this alone. Stay connected to your community. Your sponsor. Your therapist. Your support system.

Connection keeps you sober.

**4. Give back**  
You've learned so much. Now, share it.

Help someone who's where you were 30 days ago. Sponsor someone. Volunteer. Give back.

Service is how you solidify your own recovery.

**5. Be patient with yourself**  
You're not going to have it all figured out. You're going to make mistakes. You're going to struggle.

And that's okay.

Recovery is a journey. Not a destination.

Be patient with yourself.

**6. Celebrate how far you've come**  
30 days ago, you started this journey.

And look at you now.

You've learned. You've grown. You've healed.

Celebrate that.

**7. Remember your why**  
Why did you start this journey? What are you staying sober for?

Write it down. Look at it every day.

Your why will keep you going when it gets hard.

**8. Trust the process**  
You don't have to have it all figured out.

Trust that you're exactly where you need to be.

Trust that you're growing. Trust that you're healing.

Trust the process.

Here's what I want you to know:

You are not broken. You never were.

You were wounded. And you adapted. And you survived.

And now, you're healing.

You're becoming who you were always meant to be.

The version of you who's free. Who's whole. Who's at peace.

That version of you is already here. You just have to keep showing up.

So keep going.

Keep doing the work. Keep showing up. Keep growing.

This is your new beginning.

And I can't wait to see where you go from here.

You've got this.

I believe in you.

Let's keep going.
