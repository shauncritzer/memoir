### Day 1: Why Your Nervous System Is Running the Show

**Duration:** 10-12 minutes  
**Tone:** Compassionate, educational, hopeful

---

Hey, I'm Shaun Critzer. I've been sober for 13 years, and today I want to talk about something that changed everything for me—understanding that my nervous system was running the show the whole time.

For years, I thought addiction was a moral failing. I thought I just needed more willpower, more discipline, more strength. But here's what I learned: addiction isn't a character defect. It's your nervous system trying to survive.

Let me explain.

When you grow up with trauma—whether that's abuse, neglect, chaos, or just feeling fundamentally unsafe—your nervous system gets wired differently. It's like your internal alarm system is stuck on high alert. You're constantly scanning for danger, even when there isn't any.

This isn't your fault. This is biology. This is what happens when a developing brain tries to adapt to an unsafe environment.

So what does your nervous system do? It looks for ways to regulate. Ways to calm down. Ways to feel normal, even if just for a moment.

For me, that was alcohol. Then porn. Then affairs. Then obsessive bodybuilding. I wasn't weak—I was dysregulated.

Dysregulation means your nervous system can't self-soothe. It can't find balance. It swings between hyperarousal—anxiety, panic, rage—and hypoarousal—numbness, depression, shutdown.

And substances or compulsive behaviors? They work. Temporarily. They bring you back to baseline. They quiet the noise. They make you feel human again.

But here's the problem: they don't heal the dysregulation. They just mask it. And over time, you need more and more to get the same effect.

This is why willpower doesn't work. You're not fighting a lack of discipline. You're fighting a nervous system that's trying to survive.

So what's the solution?

First, you have to understand this isn't your fault. You didn't choose to have a dysregulated nervous system. You adapted to survive.

Second, you have to learn new ways to regulate. Somatic practices. Breathwork. Grounding techniques. Therapy. Community. These aren't luxuries—they're necessities.

Third, you have to be patient with yourself. Your nervous system has been wired this way for years, maybe decades. It's going to take time to rewire it.

But here's the good news: it IS possible. Your brain is neuroplastic. It can change. You can heal.

Over the next seven days, we're going to walk through this together. You're going to learn how to recognize dysregulation, how to respond to it, and how to build a life that supports nervous system healing.

You're not broken. You're not weak. You're not a failure.

You're a human being with a nervous system that's been trying to protect you the only way it knows how.

And now, you're going to learn a better way.

Let's do this.

### Day 2: What Trauma Actually Did to Your Body

**Duration:** 10-12 minutes  
**Tone:** Validating, educational, empowering

---

Welcome back. Yesterday we talked about how your nervous system is running the show. Today, we're going deeper—we're talking about what trauma actually did to your body.

And I want to be clear: when I say trauma, I'm not just talking about the big, obvious stuff. I'm talking about anything that made you feel unsafe, unseen, or unloved as a kid.

Maybe it was overt abuse—physical, sexual, emotional. Maybe it was neglect—being left alone, ignored, or dismissed. Maybe it was chaos—addiction in the home, violence, unpredictability.

Or maybe it was more subtle. Maybe it was a parent who was emotionally unavailable. A sibling who bullied you. A school environment where you never felt like you belonged.

All of these experiences shape your nervous system. And here's what most people don't understand: trauma isn't just a memory. It's stored in your body.

When you experience trauma, especially as a child, your body goes into survival mode. Your sympathetic nervous system kicks in—fight, flight, or freeze.

But here's the problem: if you're a kid, you can't fight. You can't flee. So what do you do? You freeze. You dissociate. You learn to numb out.

And if this happens over and over again—if you're living in a chronic state of threat—your nervous system gets stuck.

You become hypervigilant. You're always scanning for danger. Your heart rate is elevated. Your cortisol levels are through the roof. You can't relax, even when you're safe.

Or you go the opposite direction—you shut down. You dissociate. You feel numb, disconnected, like you're watching your life from the outside.

This is what Dr. Bessel van der Kolk calls "the body keeps the score." Your body remembers the trauma, even if your conscious mind doesn't.

And here's where addiction comes in.

When you use a substance or engage in a compulsive behavior, you're not just chasing a high. You're trying to regulate your nervous system. You're trying to feel normal.

Alcohol calms the hyperarousal. Porn gives you a dopamine hit when you're shut down. Affairs make you feel alive when you've been numb for years.

You're not weak. You're not broken. You're self-medicating a nervous system that's been stuck in survival mode since childhood.

So what do we do about it?

First, we have to acknowledge the trauma. We have to stop minimizing it. "It wasn't that bad." "Other people had it worse." "I should just get over it."

No. Your pain is real. Your trauma is valid. And it's affecting your life right now, today.

Second, we have to learn somatic practices—ways to release trauma from the body. This isn't just talk therapy. This is breathwork, movement, grounding, EMDR, somatic experiencing.

Third, we have to build safety. Your nervous system needs to know it's safe before it can heal. This means boundaries, routines, supportive relationships, and environments where you can let your guard down.

Trauma isn't your fault. But healing is your responsibility.

And the good news? You're already here. You're already doing the work.

Let's keep going.

### Day 3: Why Willpower Fails Every Time

**Duration:** 10-12 minutes  
**Tone:** Honest, relatable, solution-focused

---

Let's talk about willpower. Specifically, why it fails. Every. Single. Time.

I spent years thinking I just needed to try harder. I needed to be stronger. I needed to white-knuckle my way through cravings and urges and triggers.

And you know what happened? I relapsed. Over and over again.

Because here's the truth: willpower is a finite resource. And when you're dealing with addiction, you're not just fighting a craving—you're fighting a dysregulated nervous system.

Let me break this down.

Willpower lives in your prefrontal cortex—the rational, decision-making part of your brain. This is the part that says, "I know I shouldn't drink. I know this is bad for me. I'm going to make a different choice."

But addiction lives in your limbic system—the emotional, survival-oriented part of your brain. This is the part that says, "I'm in pain. I need relief. NOW."

And when your limbic system is activated—when you're triggered, stressed, or dysregulated—your prefrontal cortex goes offline.

You literally cannot access rational thought in that moment. Your brain is in survival mode.

So what happens? You use. You relapse. You engage in the compulsive behavior.

And then what? Shame. Guilt. Self-loathing. "Why can't I just stop? What's wrong with me?"

Nothing is wrong with you. You're just trying to use a cognitive solution for a nervous system problem.

Here's the other issue with willpower: it gets depleted.

Every decision you make throughout the day—what to eat, what to wear, what to say, how to respond—uses up willpower. It's like a battery that drains over time.

And if you're white-knuckling your way through cravings all day, by the time evening hits, you've got nothing left. That's why most relapses happen at night.

So if willpower doesn't work, what does?

Three things: regulation, routine, and resources.

**Regulation:** You have to learn how to calm your nervous system BEFORE you're triggered. This means daily practices—breathwork, meditation, grounding, movement. You're building nervous system resilience.

**Routine:** You have to remove decision fatigue. Structure your day so you're not constantly making choices. Same wake-up time. Same meals. Same meetings. Same bedtime. Routine creates safety.

**Resources:** You have to have a plan for when cravings hit. Not "I'll just use willpower." But "I'll call my sponsor. I'll go to a meeting. I'll do 10 minutes of breathwork. I'll text my accountability partner."

Willpower is not the answer. Nervous system regulation is.

You're not failing because you're weak. You're failing because you're using the wrong tool.

Let's build a better toolkit.

### Day 4: Somatic Tools That Actually Help

**Duration:** 10-12 minutes  
**Tone:** Practical, empowering, hands-on

---

Alright, we've spent three days talking about the problem. Today, we're talking about solutions.

Specifically, somatic tools—body-based practices that help you regulate your nervous system in real time.

These aren't just nice-to-haves. These are essentials. These are the tools that will keep you sober when willpower fails.

Let's start with the most powerful tool you have: your breath.

**Box Breathing:**  
Inhale for 4 counts. Hold for 4 counts. Exhale for 4 counts. Hold for 4 counts. Repeat for 2-3 minutes.

This activates your parasympathetic nervous system—the rest-and-digest response. It tells your body it's safe. It calms the fight-or-flight response.

You can do this anywhere. In your car. At your desk. Before bed. When you feel a craving coming on.

**Grounding:**  
When you're dysregulated, you're often dissociated—disconnected from your body. Grounding brings you back.

5-4-3-2-1 technique: Name 5 things you can see. 4 things you can touch. 3 things you can hear. 2 things you can smell. 1 thing you can taste.

Or just plant your feet on the ground. Feel the weight of your body. Press your hands together. Splash cold water on your face.

The goal is to get out of your head and into your body.

**Movement:**  
Trauma gets stored in the body. Movement releases it.

This doesn't have to be intense. Walk. Stretch. Shake. Dance. Do yoga. Lift weights.

The key is to move with intention. Pay attention to how your body feels. Notice where you're holding tension. Breathe into it.

**Bilateral Stimulation:**  
This is the basis of EMDR therapy. You're activating both hemispheres of your brain to process trauma.

Tap your knees alternately. Cross your arms and tap your shoulders. Walk and focus on the left-right rhythm.

This helps your brain integrate traumatic memories instead of staying stuck in them.

**Cold Exposure:**  
Cold showers, ice baths, or even splashing cold water on your face activates your vagus nerve—the main nerve of your parasympathetic nervous system.

It's an instant nervous system reset. It's uncomfortable, but it works.

**Humming or Singing:**  
This also stimulates the vagus nerve. Hum. Sing. Chant. It sounds weird, but it's incredibly calming.

Here's the key: you have to practice these tools when you're NOT in crisis.

If you only try breathwork when you're in the middle of a craving, it's not going to work. You have to build the skill first.

So here's your assignment: pick one tool. Practice it every day for the next four days. Make it a non-negotiable part of your routine.

Your nervous system is trainable. You just have to train it.

Let's do this.

### Day 5: Process Addictions Are Real Addictions

**Duration:** 10-12 minutes  
**Tone:** Validating, educational, inclusive

---

Let's talk about something that doesn't get enough attention: process addictions.

Most people think of addiction as substances—alcohol, drugs, pills. And yes, those are addictions.

But what about porn? Affairs? Work? Fitness? Bodybuilding? Shopping? Gaming? Social media?

These are process addictions—compulsive behaviors that hijack your brain's reward system the same way substances do.

And here's what I want you to know: they're just as real. They're just as destructive. And they deserve just as much attention.

I didn't just struggle with alcohol. I struggled with porn. With affairs. With obsessive bodybuilding.

And for years, I minimized it. "At least I'm not drinking." "At least I'm not doing drugs." "At least I'm working out—that's healthy, right?"

Wrong.

A compulsive behavior is a compulsive behavior. It doesn't matter if it's socially acceptable. It doesn't matter if it looks productive from the outside.

If you're using it to escape, to numb, to regulate your nervous system—it's an addiction.

Here's how you know:

- You can't stop, even when you want to.
- It's causing problems in your relationships, your work, your health.
- You feel shame, guilt, or secrecy around it.
- You're using it to cope with emotions you don't want to feel.

That's addiction.

And here's why process addictions are so insidious: they're harder to quit than substances.

With alcohol, you can remove it from your life completely. You don't need alcohol to survive.

But you can't quit eating. You can't quit working. You can't quit the internet.

So you have to learn moderation. You have to learn boundaries. You have to learn how to engage with these things in a healthy way.

And that's hard. Really hard.

But it's possible.

Here's what helped me:

**Identify the function:** What is this behavior doing for you? Is it calming anxiety? Numbing pain? Providing connection? Once you know the function, you can find healthier alternatives.

**Set boundaries:** If it's work, set work hours. If it's fitness, set rest days. If it's social media, set screen time limits. Boundaries aren't punishment—they're protection.

**Get support:** Process addictions thrive in secrecy. Bring them into the light. Tell your sponsor. Tell your therapist. Tell your accountability partner.

**Address the root:** Process addictions are symptoms of nervous system dysregulation. You have to heal the trauma underneath.

You're not weak. You're not broken. You're human.

And if you're struggling with a process addiction, you're not alone.

Let's heal this together.

### Day 6: Relapse Isn't Failure, It's Data

**Duration:** 10-12 minutes  
**Tone:** Compassionate, reframing, hopeful

---

Let's talk about relapse.

Most people see relapse as failure. As proof that they're not strong enough. As evidence that recovery isn't working.

I see it differently.

Relapse isn't failure. It's data.

Let me explain.

When you relapse, you're not starting over. You're not back at square one. You're learning.

You're learning what your triggers are. You're learning what situations put you at risk. You're learning what tools work and what tools don't.

And that information is invaluable.

Here's the truth: most people relapse. Multiple times. That doesn't mean recovery doesn't work. It means recovery is a process, not an event.

So instead of beating yourself up, ask yourself: what can I learn from this?

- What was I feeling before I used?
- What was happening in my life?
- What warning signs did I ignore?
- What tool could I have used instead?

This is how you build resilience. This is how you get better at recovery.

Now, I'm not saying relapse is inevitable. I'm not saying you should plan to relapse. I'm saying if it happens, it doesn't mean you're a failure.

It means you're human.

Here's what to do if you relapse:

**1. Don't spiral:** One use doesn't have to become a week-long bender. Stop as soon as you can. Get back on track immediately.

**2. Reach out:** Call your sponsor. Go to a meeting. Text your accountability partner. Don't isolate. Shame thrives in secrecy.

**3. Analyze it:** What happened? What was the trigger? What was the emotional state? What could you do differently next time?

**4. Adjust your plan:** Maybe you need more meetings. Maybe you need a new therapist. Maybe you need to remove a person or place from your life. Use the data to make changes.

**5. Forgive yourself:** This is the hardest part. But it's the most important. You're not a bad person. You're a person in recovery. And recovery is messy.

Here's what I know: the people who stay sober long-term aren't the people who never relapse. They're the people who get back up every time they fall.

They're the people who learn from their mistakes. They're the people who refuse to give up.

You're one of those people.

So if you've relapsed, I want you to hear this: you're not a failure. You're a fighter.

And you're going to make it.

### Day 7: Building Your Recovery Toolkit

**Duration:** 10-12 minutes  
**Tone:** Empowering, practical, celebratory

---

We made it. Day 7.

You've spent the last six days learning about nervous system dysregulation, trauma, willpower, somatic tools, process addictions, and relapse.

Today, we're putting it all together. We're building your recovery toolkit.

Because here's the truth: recovery isn't one thing. It's a collection of tools, practices, and resources that you use every single day.

So let's build your toolkit.

**Tool #1: Daily Practices**  
These are non-negotiables. Things you do every day, no matter what.

- Breathwork (5-10 minutes)
- Meditation or prayer (5-10 minutes)
- Movement (walk, yoga, weights, etc.)
- Gratitude practice (write down 3 things)
- Check-in with yourself (how am I feeling? What do I need today?)

These practices regulate your nervous system. They build resilience. They keep you grounded.

**Tool #2: Support System**  
You cannot do this alone. You need people.

- Sponsor or mentor
- Therapist or counselor
- Accountability partner
- Recovery community (meetings, groups, etc.)
- Friends and family who support your sobriety

Isolation is the enemy of recovery. Connection is the antidote.

**Tool #3: Emergency Plan**  
What do you do when a craving hits? When you're triggered? When you're on the edge?

Write it down. Make it specific.

- Call my sponsor
- Go to a meeting (have a list of meeting times)
- Do 10 minutes of box breathing
- Take a cold shower
- Go for a walk
- Text my accountability partner
- Read recovery literature
- Watch a recovery video

You need a plan BEFORE the crisis. Not during.

**Tool #4: Boundaries**  
What people, places, or things do you need to remove from your life?

- Toxic relationships
- Triggering environments
- Access to substances or compulsive behaviors

Boundaries aren't mean. They're self-care.

**Tool #5: Purpose**  
What are you staying sober for? What's your why?

- Your kids
- Your health
- Your relationships
- Your career
- Your peace of mind
- Your future self

Write it down. Look at it every day.

**Tool #6: Self-Compassion**  
This is the hardest tool. But it's the most important.

You're going to mess up. You're going to have bad days. You're going to struggle.

And when that happens, you have to talk to yourself the way you'd talk to a friend.

Not with shame. Not with judgment. But with kindness.

"I'm doing the best I can. I'm learning. I'm growing. I'm not perfect, but I'm trying."

That's the voice that keeps you sober.

So here's your assignment: take the next hour and build your toolkit. Write it down. Make it real.

And then use it. Every single day.

You've got this.

I believe in you.

Let's keep going.

## From Broken to Whole Course (30 Videos)

### Week 1: Understanding Your Story

#### Day 1: The Trauma-Addiction Connection

**Duration:** 12-15 minutes  
**Tone:** Educational, validating, foundational

---

Welcome to From Broken to Whole. Over the next 30 days, we're going deep. We're going to unpack the trauma-addiction connection, heal your nervous system, process shame, rebuild relationships, and discover purpose.

This isn't a quick fix. This is transformation.

Let's start with the foundation: the trauma-addiction connection.

Here's what most people get wrong about addiction: they think it's about the substance or the behavior.

It's not.

Addiction is about pain. And more specifically, it's about unprocessed trauma.

Dr. Gabor Maté says it best: "The question isn't why the addiction, but why the pain."

So let's talk about the pain.

Trauma is any experience that overwhelms your capacity to cope. It's not about the event itself—it's about how your nervous system responds to it.

For some people, that's overt abuse—physical, sexual, emotional. For others, it's neglect—being ignored, dismissed, or abandoned. For others, it's chaos—growing up in a home with addiction, violence, or instability.

And for many, it's more subtle. It's emotional unavailability. It's conditional love. It's feeling like you were never enough.

All of these experiences shape your nervous system. They teach you that the world is unsafe. That people can't be trusted. That you have to protect yourself.

And here's where addiction comes in.

When you use a substance or engage in a compulsive behavior, you're not just chasing pleasure. You're self-medicating pain.

You're trying to numb the anxiety. Quiet the shame. Escape the emptiness. Feel alive when you've been numb for years.

Addiction is a solution. It's not a good solution, but it's a solution.

And until you address the pain underneath, you'll keep going back to it.

This is why abstinence alone doesn't work. You can white-knuckle your way through sobriety, but if you don't heal the trauma, you're just dry—not sober.

So what does healing look like?

It starts with understanding. Understanding that your addiction isn't a moral failing. It's a survival strategy.

It continues with processing. Processing the trauma. Feeling the feelings you've been running from. Grieving what you lost.

And it ends with integration. Integrating the pain into your story. Not as something that defines you, but as something that shaped you.

You're not broken. You're wounded.

And wounds can heal.

Over the next 30 days, we're going to do that healing together.

Let's begin.

#### Day 2: Attachment Wounds and How They Show Up

**Duration:** 12-15 minutes  
**Tone:** Compassionate, insightful, relational

---

Today we're talking about attachment.

Attachment is the bond you form with your primary caregivers as a child. It's how you learn to relate to others. It's how you learn to trust. It's how you learn to regulate your emotions.

And if that bond is disrupted—if your caregivers are inconsistent, unavailable, or abusive—you develop an insecure attachment style.

And that insecure attachment shows up in your adult relationships. And in your addiction.

There are three main insecure attachment styles:

**Anxious Attachment:**  
You crave closeness, but you're terrified of abandonment. You're clingy. You're needy. You're constantly seeking reassurance.

In addiction, this shows up as using to cope with relationship anxiety. You drink when your partner pulls away. You use porn when you feel rejected. You engage in affairs to feel wanted.

**Avoidant Attachment:**  
You value independence above all else. You keep people at arm's length. You don't trust anyone to meet your needs, so you don't ask.

In addiction, this shows up as using to avoid intimacy. You drink to numb the loneliness. You work obsessively to avoid connection. You use substances to keep people from getting too close.

**Disorganized Attachment:**  
You want closeness, but you're terrified of it. You push people away, then pull them back. You're chaotic in relationships.

In addiction, this shows up as using to manage the chaos. You drink to calm the anxiety of intimacy. You engage in compulsive behaviors to feel in control when relationships feel out of control.

Here's the thing: these attachment styles aren't your fault. They're adaptations. They're how you learned to survive in an environment that wasn't safe.

But they're also keeping you stuck.

Because insecure attachment makes it hard to build the relationships you need for recovery. It makes it hard to trust your sponsor. It makes it hard to be vulnerable in therapy. It makes it hard to let people in.

So how do you heal attachment wounds?

**1. Awareness:** Recognize your attachment style. Notice how it shows up in your relationships.

**2. Therapy:** Work with a therapist who understands attachment. This is deep work. You can't do it alone.

**3. Corrective experiences:** Build relationships with people who are consistent, safe, and trustworthy. Let them show you that not everyone will abandon you. Not everyone will hurt you.

**4. Self-compassion:** Be patient with yourself. These patterns have been with you for decades. They're not going to change overnight.

Attachment wounds are some of the deepest wounds we carry.

But they can heal.

And when they do, everything changes.

#### Day 3: The Four Nervous System States

**Duration:** 12-15 minutes  
**Tone:** Educational, practical, empowering

---

Let's talk about the four nervous system states. This is foundational to understanding how trauma shows up in your body.

Your nervous system has two main branches: the sympathetic nervous system (fight or flight) and the parasympathetic nervous system (rest and digest).

But it's more nuanced than that. There are actually four states:

**1. Ventral Vagal (Safe and Social):**  
This is your optimal state. You feel calm, connected, and engaged. Your heart rate is steady. Your breathing is easy. You can think clearly and relate to others.

This is where you want to be most of the time.

**2. Sympathetic (Fight or Flight):**  
This is your stress response. Your heart rate increases. Your breathing gets shallow. Your muscles tense. You're ready to fight or run.

This is helpful in actual danger. But if you're stuck here chronically, it shows up as anxiety, hypervigilance, irritability, and insomnia.

**3. Dorsal Vagal (Freeze):**  
This is your shutdown response. When fight or flight doesn't work, your body freezes. You dissociate. You numb out. You feel disconnected from your body.

This shows up as depression, fatigue, brain fog, and emotional numbness.

**4. Fawn (People-Pleasing):**  
This is a trauma response where you appease others to stay safe. You abandon your own needs to meet theirs. You become a chameleon, shapeshifting to avoid conflict.

This shows up as codependency, lack of boundaries, and losing yourself in relationships.

Here's the key: addiction is a way to move between these states.

If you're stuck in sympathetic (anxious, hypervigilant), you drink to calm down. You use substances to drop into dorsal vagal (numb, shut down).

If you're stuck in dorsal vagal (depressed, disconnected), you use stimulants or engage in compulsive behaviors to jump into sympathetic (feel alive, feel something).

You're not using because you're weak. You're using because your nervous system is dysregulated.

So how do you regulate?

**1. Recognize your state:** Throughout the day, check in. Where am I right now? Ventral vagal? Sympathetic? Dorsal vagal? Fawn?

**2. Use tools to shift:** If you're in sympathetic, use calming tools (breathwork, grounding). If you're in dorsal vagal, use activating tools (movement, cold exposure).

**3. Build ventral vagal capacity:** Spend time with safe people. Engage in activities that bring you joy. Practice gratitude. These all strengthen your ability to stay in the safe and social state.

Your nervous system is trainable.

You just have to train it.

#### Day 4: Fight, Flight, Freeze, Fawn

**Duration:** 12-15 minutes  
**Tone:** Validating, educational, practical

---

We touched on the four trauma responses yesterday. Today, we're going deeper.

Because understanding your dominant trauma response is key to understanding your addiction.

**Fight:**  
When you're in fight mode, you respond to threat with anger, aggression, or control.

You pick fights. You lash out. You dominate. You micromanage.

In addiction, this shows up as using to manage rage. You drink to calm the anger. You use substances to avoid exploding.

**Flight:**  
When you're in flight mode, you respond to threat by escaping.

You stay busy. You work obsessively. You avoid. You run.

In addiction, this shows up as using to escape. You drink to avoid feelings. You use porn to avoid intimacy. You work to avoid being present.

**Freeze:**  
When you're in freeze mode, you shut down. You dissociate. You numb out.

You feel paralyzed. You can't make decisions. You feel disconnected from your body.

In addiction, this shows up as using to feel something. You use stimulants to wake up. You engage in risky behaviors to feel alive.

**Fawn:**  
When you're in fawn mode, you people-please. You abandon your needs to meet others'.

You say yes when you mean no. You lose yourself in relationships. You become a chameleon.

In addiction, this shows up as using to cope with codependency. You drink to tolerate relationships that hurt you. You use substances to numb the resentment of always putting others first.

Here's the thing: most people have a dominant response. But you can cycle through all four.

And here's why this matters: you can't heal what you don't understand.

If you don't know that your anger is a fight response, you'll just think you're a bad person.

If you don't know that your people-pleasing is a fawn response, you'll just think you're weak.

But once you understand that these are trauma responses—adaptations you developed to survive—you can start to heal them.

So here's your assignment:

Identify your dominant trauma response. Notice when it shows up. And start to ask: what am I protecting myself from?

That's where the healing begins.

#### Day 5: How Childhood Trauma Shaped Your Nervous System

**Duration:** 12-15 minutes  
**Tone:** Compassionate, educational, validating

---

Let's talk about how childhood trauma shaped your nervous system.

Your nervous system develops in the first few years of life. And it develops in relationship with your caregivers.

If your caregivers are safe, consistent, and attuned, your nervous system learns that the world is safe. You develop secure attachment. You learn to regulate your emotions. You learn to trust.

But if your caregivers are inconsistent, unavailable, or abusive, your nervous system learns that the world is dangerous. You develop insecure attachment. You learn to self-soothe in unhealthy ways. You learn to protect yourself.

And here's the key: this isn't conscious. This is happening at a neurological level.

Your brain is wiring itself based on your environment.

So if you grow up in chaos, your brain wires for hypervigilance. You're always scanning for danger. You can't relax, even when you're safe.

If you grow up with neglect, your brain wires for shutdown. You learn to dissociate. You learn to numb out.

If you grow up with abuse, your brain wires for survival. Fight, flight, freeze, fawn.

And here's the problem: these patterns don't just go away when you become an adult.

They stay with you. They show up in your relationships. They show up in your work. They show up in your addiction.

You're not broken. You're adapted.

But here's the good news: your brain is neuroplastic. It can change.

You can rewire your nervous system. You can build new neural pathways. You can heal.

But it takes time. And it takes intention.

Here's how:

**1. Therapy:** Especially trauma-focused therapy like EMDR, somatic experiencing, or internal family systems.

**2. Somatic practices:** Breathwork, yoga, movement, grounding. These help you release trauma from your body.

**3. Safe relationships:** Surround yourself with people who are consistent, trustworthy, and attuned. Let them show you what safety feels like.

**4. Self-compassion:** Be patient with yourself. Your nervous system has been wired this way for decades. It's going to take time to rewire it.

You didn't choose the trauma. But you can choose the healing.

Let's do this together.

#### Day 6: The Role of Shame in Addiction

**Duration:** 12-15 minutes  
**Tone:** Compassionate, validating, transformative

---

Let's talk about shame.

Shame is the belief that you are fundamentally flawed. That you are bad. That you are unworthy of love.

And shame is the fuel of addiction.

Here's how it works:

You experience trauma. You internalize the message that you're not enough. You carry shame.

You use substances or compulsive behaviors to numb the shame. Temporarily, it works.

But then you feel shame about using. "I'm weak. I'm a failure. I can't even stay sober."

So you use again to numb the shame about using.

This is the shame-addiction cycle. And it's vicious.

Brené Brown says, "Shame thrives in secrecy, silence, and judgment."

And that's exactly how addiction operates. You hide. You isolate. You judge yourself.

And the more you hide, the more shame you feel. And the more shame you feel, the more you use.

So how do you break the cycle?

**1. Bring it into the light:** Shame loses its power when you speak it out loud. Tell your sponsor. Tell your therapist. Tell your accountability partner.

**2. Separate shame from guilt:** Guilt says, "I did something bad." Shame says, "I am bad." Guilt is helpful—it motivates change. Shame is toxic—it keeps you stuck.

**3. Practice self-compassion:** Talk to yourself the way you'd talk to a friend. Not with judgment, but with kindness.

**4. Build shame resilience:** Surround yourself with people who see you, accept you, and love you—even when you mess up.

Here's what I want you to know: you are not your addiction. You are not your mistakes. You are not your shame.

You are a human being who is worthy of love, belonging, and healing.

And the more you believe that, the less power shame has over you.

Let's heal this together.

#### Day 7: Grieving What You Lost

**Duration:** 12-15 minutes  
**Tone:** Compassionate, cathartic, hopeful

---

Let's talk about grief.

When you get sober, you don't just lose the substance or the behavior. You lose a lot more.

You lose the version of yourself who used. You lose the relationships that were built around using. You lose the coping mechanism that got you through the hardest moments of your life.

And you have to grieve that.

Most people skip this step. They think, "I should just be grateful I'm sober. Why am I sad?"

Because grief is a natural part of loss. And sobriety is loss.

Here's what you might be grieving:

- The time you lost to addiction
- The relationships you damaged or destroyed
- The opportunities you missed
- The version of yourself you could have been
- The childhood you never had
- The safety you never felt

This grief is real. And it's valid.

And if you don't process it, it will keep you stuck.

So how do you grieve?

**1. Feel it:** Don't numb it. Don't avoid it. Sit with the sadness. Cry. Journal. Let it move through you.

**2. Talk about it:** Share it with your therapist, your sponsor, your support group. Grief needs witnesses.

**3. Ritualize it:** Write a letter to your past self. Create a ceremony to honor what you lost. Plant a tree. Light a candle.

**4. Give yourself time:** Grief doesn't have a timeline. Be patient with yourself.

And here's the beautiful part: on the other side of grief is acceptance.

Acceptance that you can't change the past. Acceptance that you did the best you could with what you had. Acceptance that you're here now, doing the work.

And from acceptance comes peace.

You're not just getting sober. You're becoming whole.

And that requires grieving what was, so you can step into what will be.

Let's keep going.
